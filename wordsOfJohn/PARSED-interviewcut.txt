 i think it’s the best thing i’ve ever done i think it’s realistic and it’s true to the me that has been developing over the years from my life i’m a loser help strawberry fields they are all personal records i always wrote about me when i could i didn’t really enjoy writing third person songs about people who lived in concrete flats and things like that i like first person music but because of my hang-ups and many other things; i would only now and then specifically write about me now i wrote all about me and that’s why i like it it’s me! and nobody else that’s why i like it it’s real that’s all  because there was none in my head there were no hallucinations in my head  actually that’s paul’s line i was consciously writing poetry and that’s self-conscious poetry but the poetry on this album is superior to anything i’ve done because it’s not self-conscious in that way i had the least trouble writing the songs of all time  there’s no bullshit  well i’ve always liked simple rock there’s a great one in england now i hear you knocking i liked the spirit in the sky a few months back i always liked simple rock and nothing else i was influenced by acid and got psychedelic like the whole generation but really i like rock and roll and i express myself best in rock i had a few ideas to do this with mother and that with mother but when you just hear the piano does it all for you your mind can do the rest i think the backings on mine are as complicated as the backings on any record you’ve ever heard if you’ve got an ear  what’s litany  well like a lot of the words it just came out of me mouth god was put together from three songs almost i had the idea that god is the concept by which we measure pain so that when you have a word like that you just sit down and sing the first tune that comes into your head and the tune is simple because i like that kind of music and then i just rolled into it it was just going on in my head and i got by the first three or four the rest just came out whatever came out  i don’t know when i realized that i was putting down all these things i didn’t believe in so i could have gone on it was like a christmas card list where do i end churchill hoover i thought i had to stop  yes i was going to leave a gap and just fill in your own words whoever you don’t believe in it had just got out of hand and beatles was the final thing because i no longer believe in myth and beatles is another myth  i didn’t know that i don’t know i’ll be able to tell in a week or so what’s going on because they [the radio] started off playing look at me because it was easy and they probably thought it was the beatles or something so i don’t know if that is the one well that’s the one; god and working class hero probably are the best whatevers–sort of ideas or feelings–on the record  because dylan is bullshit zimmerman is his name you see i don’t believe in dylan and i don’t believe in tom jones either in that way zimmerman is his name my name isn’t john beatle it’s john lennon just like that  because that’s what’s happened all these songs just came out of me i didn’t sit down to think i’m going to write about mother or i didn’t sit down to think i’m going to write about this that or the other they all came out like all the best work that anybody ever does whether it is an article or what it’s just the best ones that come out and all these came out because i had time if you are on holiday or in therapy wherever you are if you do spend time like in india i wrote the last batch of best songs like i’m so tired and yer blues they’re pretty realistic they were about me they always struck me as–what is the word funny ironic–that i was writing them supposedly in the presence of guru and meditating so many hours a day writing i’m so tired and songs of such pain as yer blues which i meant i was right in the maharishi’s camp writing i wanna die  well a bit i’m a bit self-conscious–we all were a bit self-conscious and the beatles were super self-conscious people about parody of americans which we do and have done  yes there was a self-consciousness about singing blues we were all listening to sleepy john estes and all that in art school like everybody else but to sing it was something else i’m self conscious about doing it  nobody knows there is a point on the first song on yoko’s track where the guitar comes in and even yoko thought it was her voice because we did all yoko’s in one night the whole session except for the track with ornette coleman from the past that we put on to show people that she wasn’t discovered by the beatles and that she’s been around a few years we got stuff of her with cage ornette coleman we are going to put out oldies but goldies next for yoko i’ll play it again and talk about it later  why  no no listen to cold turkey  listen to twist and shout i couldn’t sing the damn thing i was just screaming listen to it wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-wop-bam-boom don’t get the therapy confused with the music yoko’s whole thing was that scream don’t worry kyoko was one of the fuckin’ best rock and roll records ever made listen to it and play tutti fruitti listen to don’t worry kyoko on the other side of cold turkey  so is this you know i announced cold turkey at the lyceum saying i’m going to sing a song about pain so pain and screaming was before janov i mean janov showed me more of my own pain i went through therapy with him like i told you and i’m probably looser all over  no janov showed me how to feel my own fear and pain therefore i can handle it better than i could before that’s all i’m the same only there’s a channel it doesn’t just remain in me it goes round and out i can move a little easier  it just was not too much fun i never injected it or anything we sniffed a little when we were in real pain we got such a hard time from everyone and i’ve had so much thrown at me and at yoko especially at yoko like peter brown in our office–and you can put this in–after we come in after six months he comes down and shakes my hand and doesn’t even say hello to her that’s going on all the time and we get into so much pain that we have to do something about it and that’s what happened to us we took h because of what the beatles and others were doing to us but we got out of it  but let’s not take away from what he did do which expended a lot of energy and taught me a lot and i would use him again  well i learned a lot on this album technically i didn’t have to learn so much before usually paul and i would be listening to it and we wouldn’t have to listen to each individual sound so there are a few things i learned this time about bass one track or another where you can get more in and where i lost something on a track and some technical things that irritated me finally but as a concept and as a whole thing i’m pleased yes that’s about it really if i get down to the nitty gritty it would drive me mad but i do like it really  i like both i go for feeling most takes are right off and most times i sang it and played it at the same time i can’t stand putting the backing on first then the singing which is what we used to do in the old days but those days are dead you know  well i was watching tv as usual in california and there was this old horror movie on and the bells sounded like that to me it was probably different because those were actually bells slowed down that they used on the album they just sounded like that and i thought oh that’s how to start mother i knew mother was going to be the first track so  well actually some of it actually i wrote mother in england isolation in england and a few more i finished them off in california you will have to push me if you want more detail look at me was written around the beatles’ double album time you know i just never got it going there are a few like that lying around  when did i say that  i haven’t gone off it it is just that primal is like another mirror you know  it’s really like you know writers take themselves to singapore to get the atmosphere so wherever i am in that way it is sort of a primal album it’s like george’s is the first gita album  i think that is something people will go through at the beginning of that therapy because you are so astounded with what you find out about yourself you think well surely this is something because it happens to you and this must be the first time that it happened  i don’t think anything else would work on me but then of course i’m not through with it; it’s a process that is going on we primal almost daily you see i don’t really want to get this big primal thing going because it is so embarrassing the thing in a nutshell primal therapy allowed us to feel feelings continually and those feelings usually make you cry that’s all because before i wasn’t feeling things that’s all i was blocking the feelings and when the feelings come through you cry it’s as simple as that really  maybe  it’s probably better because i have the whole time to myself you know i mean i’m pretty good at home with the tapes this time it was my album and it used to get a bit embarrassing in front of george and paul because we know each other so well we used to be a bit supercritical of each other so we inhibited each other a lot and now i have yoko there and phil there alternatively and together who sort of love me so that i can perform better and i relaxed i’ve got a whole studio at home now and i think it will be better next time because that is even less inhibiting than going to emi it’s like that but the looseness of the singing was developing on cold turkey from the experience of yoko’s singing you see she does not inhibit her throat  yes well she plays wind she played atmosphere she has a musical ear and she can produce rock and roll she can produce me which she did for some of the tracks i’m not going to start saying that she did this and he did that but when phil couldn’t come at first you don’t have to be born and bred in rock she knows when a bass sound is right and when a guy is playing out of rhythm and when the engineer–she had a bit of trouble–the engineer thinks well who the hell is this what does she know about it so she did that for me  anybody that sings with a guitar and sings about something heavy would tend to sound like this i’m bound to be influenced by those because that is the only kind of real folk music i really listen to i never liked the fruity judy collins and baez and all of that stuff so the only folk music i know is about miners up in newcastle or dylan in that way i would be influenced but it doesn’t sound like dylan to me does it sound like dylan to you  that’s the only way to play i never listen that hard to him  no i put it in because it fit i didn’t even realize that there were two in the song until somebody pointed it out when i actually sang it i missed a verse which i had to add in later you do say fucking crazy; that is how i speak i was very near to it many times in the past but i would deliberately not put it in which is the real hypocrisy the real stupidity  in england it’s the day they blew up the houses of parliament so we celebrate by having bonfires every november th guy fawkes day it just was an ad lib it was about the third take and i got to remembering and it begins to sound like frankie laine you know when you sing remember the fifth of november i just broke up and it went on for about another seven or eight minutes we started ad libbing and goofing about but then i cut it there and just exploded it was a good joke haven’t you ever heard of guy fawkes i thought it was just poignant that we should blow up the houses of parliament  i get embarrassed you see sometimes i can hear it and be embarrassed just by the performance of either the music or the statements and sometimes i don’t i change daily you know like just before it’s coming out i can’t bear to hear it in the house or play it anywhere but a few months before that i can play it all the time it just changes all the time  i don’t know what you mean really  well pain is the pain we go through all the time you’re born in pain pain is what we are in most of the time and i think that the bigger the pain the more god you look for  i never heard of it you see it was my own revelation i don’t know who wrote about it or what anybody else said i just know that’s what i know  yes i just felt it it was like i was crucified when i felt it so i know what they’re talking about now  george martin i don’t know you see for quite a few of our albums like the beatles’ double albums george martin didn’t really produce it in the early days i can remember what george martin did  he would translate if paul wanted to use violins he would translate it for him like in my life there is an elizabethan piano solo in it so he would do things like that we would say play like bach or something so he would put bars in there he helped us develop a language to talk to musicians  well it’s not instead of george martin that’s nothing personal against george martin he’s more paul’s style of music than mine but i don’t know really it’s a drag to do both to go in the recording studio and then you run back and say did you get it  yes yes phil i believe is a great artist and like all great artists he’s very neurotic but we’ve done quite a few tracks together yoko and i and she’d be encouraging me in the other room and all that and–at one point in the middle we were just lagging–phil moved in and brought in a new life we were getting heavy because we had done a few things and the thrill of recording had worn off a little so you can hear spector here and there there is no specifics you can just hear him  yes i just threw up for hours until i went on i even threw up i read a review in stone the one about the film [toronto pop by da pennebaker] i haven’t seen yet and they were saying i was this and that i was throwing up nearly in the number i could hardly sing any of them i was full of shit  always that nervous but what with one thing and another it just had to come out some way i don’t think i’ll do much appearing it’s not worth the strain i don’t want to perform too much for people  i don’t know i think it’s all right you know personally at home i wouldn’t play that kind of music i don’t want to hurt george’s feelings i don’t know what to say about it i think it’s better than paul’s  i thought paul’s was rubbish i think he’ll make a better one when he’s frightened into it but i thought that first one was just a lot of remember what i told you when it came out light and easy you know that crack but then i listen to the radio and i hear george’s stuff coming over well then it’s pretty bloody good my personal tastes are very strange you know  sounds like wop bop a loo bop i like rock and roll man i don’t like much else  that’s the music that inspired me to play music there is nothing conceptually better than rock and roll no group be it beatles dylan or stones have ever improved on whole lot of shaking for my money or maybe i’m like our parents that’s my period and i dig it and i’ll never leave it  i don’t know what it is you would have to name it i don’t think there’s  no i never listen only when i’m recording or about to bring something out will i listen just before i record i go buy a few albums to see what people are doing whether they have improved any or whether anything happened and nothing’s really happened there’s a lot of great guitarists and musicians around but nothing’s happening you know i don’t like the blood sweat and tears shit i think all that is bullshit rock and roll is going like jazz as far as i can see and the bullshitters are going off into that excellentness which i never believed in and others going off i consider myself in the avant garde of rock and roll because i’m with yoko and she taught me a lot and i taught her a lot and i think on her album you can hear it if i can get away from her album for a moment  i thought it wasn’t much because i expect more–maybe i expect too much from people – but i expect more i haven’t been a dylan follower since he stopped rocking i liked rolling stone and a few things he did then; i like a few things he did in the early days the rest of it is just like lennon-mccartney or something it’s no different its a myth  no it might be a new morning for him because he stopped singing on the top of his voice it’s all right but it’s not him it doesn’t mean a fucking thing i’d sooner have i hear you knocking by dave edmonds it’s the top of england now  i can’t imagine what george thinks well i suppose he thinks i’ve lost the way or something like that but to me i’m like home i’ll never change much from this  they remembered that they were four individuals you see we believed the beatles myth too i don’t know whether the others still believe it we were four guys i met paul and said you want to join me band then george joined and then ringo joined we were just a band that made it very very big that’s all our best work was never recorded  because we were performers–in spite of what mick says about us–in liverpool hamburg and other dance halls what we generated was fantastic when we played straight rock and there was nobody to touch us in britain as soon as we made it we made it but the edges were knocked off  i’m a very nervous person really i’m not as big-headed as this tape sounds this is me projecting through the fear so i choose people that i know rather than strangers  because in spite of all the things the beatles could really play music together when they weren’t uptight and if i get a thing going ringo knows where to go just like that and he does well we’ve played together so long that it fits that’s the only thing i sometimes miss is just being able to sort of blink or make a certain noise and i know they’ll all know where we are going on an ad lib thing but i don’t miss it that much  well it depends on what kind of guitarist i’m ok i’m not technically good but i can make it fucking howl and move i was rhythm guitarist it’s an important job i can make a band drive  he’s pretty good i prefer myself i have to be honest you know i’m really very embarrassed about my guitar playing in one way because it’s very poor i can never move but i can make a guitar speak  listen to why on yoko’s album i found out i think it’s nice it drives along ask eric clapton he thinks i can play ask him you see a lot of you people want technical things; it’s like wanting technical films most critics of rock and roll and guitarists are in the stage of the fifties when they wanted a technically perfect film finished for them and then they would feel happy  yes i played the solo on that when paul was feeling kindly he would give me a solo! maybe if he was feeling guilty that he had most of the a side or something he would give me a solo and i played the solo on that i think george produced some beautiful guitar playing but i think he’s too hung up to really let go but so is eric really maybe he’s changed they’re all so hung up we all are that’s the problem i really like bb king  i think it’s a good record i wouldn’t buy any of it you know i think it’s a good record and i was pleasantly surprised to hear beaucoups of blues that song you know i thought good i was glad and i didn’t feel as embarrassed as i did about his first record  i felt sad you know also i felt that film was set-up by paul for paul that is one of the main reasons the beatles ended i can’t speak for george but i pretty damn well know we got fed up of being side-men for paul  after brian died we collapsed paul took over and supposedly led us but what is leading us when we went round in circles we broke up then that was the disintegration  i don’t remember you know i was in my own pain i wasn’t noticing really i just did it like a job the beatles broke up after brian died; we made the double album the set it’s like if you took each track off it and made it all mine and all george’s it’s like i told you many times it was just me and a backing group paul and a backing group and i enjoyed it we broke up then  we were in wales with the maharishi we had just gone down after seeing his lecture first night we heard it then and then we went right off into the maharishi thing  in wales a place called bangor in wales  we were just outside a lecture hall with maharishi and i don’t know i can’t remember it just sort of came over somebody came up to us the press were there because we had gone down with this strange indian and they said brian’s dead and i was stunned we went in to him what he’s dead and all were i suppose and the marharishi we went in to him what he’s dead and all that and he was sort of saying oh forget it be happy like an idiot like parents smile that’s what the maharishi said and we did  the feeling that anybody has when somebody close to them dies there is a sort of little hysterical sort of hee hee i’m glad it’s not me or something in it the funny feeling when somebody close to you dies i don’t know whether you’ve had it but i’ve had a lot of people die around me and the other feeling is what the fuck what can i do  well we went with maharishi i remember being in wales and then i can’t remember though i will probably have to have a bloody primal to remember this i don’t remember it just all happened  i don’t know how the others took it it’s no good asking me it’s like asking me how you took it i don’t know i’m in me own head i can’t be in anybody else’s i don’t know really what george paul or ringo think anymore i know them pretty well but i don’t know anybody that well yoko i know about the best i don’t know how they felt it was my own thing we were all just dazed  that’s right i don’t know how much of this i want to put out paul had an impression he has it now like a parent that we should be thankful for what he did for keeping the beatles going but when you look back upon it objectively he kept it going for his own sake was it for my sake paul struggled  that ended i don’t know around  or something i don’t know if you give me the albums i can tell you exactly who wrote what and which line we sometimes wrote together all our best work–apart from the early days like i want to hold your hand we wrote together and things like that–we wrote apart always the one after  on the let it be lp i wrote when i was or  we always wrote separately but we wrote together because we enjoyed it a lot sometimes and also because they would say well you’re going to make an album get together and knock off a few songs just like a job  i don’t know i don’t know probably george’s i have no idea yoko and i met around then i lost me nerve because i was going to take me ex-wife and yoko but i don’t know how to work it so i didn’t quite do it  that’s about the maharishi yes i copped out and i wouldn’t write maharishi what have you done you made a fool of everyone but now it can be told fab listeners  i don’t know i just sort of saw him  yes there was a big hullaballo about him trying to rape mia farrow or somebody and trying to get off with a few other women and things like that we went to see him after we stayed up all night discussing was it true or not true when george started thinking it might be true i thought well it must be true; because if george started thinking it might be true there must be something in it  i always do i always expect too much i was always expecting my mother and never got her that’s what it is you know or some parent i know that much  the apple thing that was to announce apple  i don’t remember that you know we all say a lot of things when we don’t know what we’re talking about i’m probably doing it now i don’t know what i say you see everybody takes you up on the words you said and i’m just a guy that people ask all about things and i blab off and some of it makes sense and some of it is bullshit and some of it’s lies and some of it is–god knows what i’m saying i don’t know what i said about maharishi all i know is what we said about apple which was worse  all right  clive epstein or some other such business freak came up to us and said you’ve got to spend so much money or the tax will take you we were thinking of opening a chain of retail clothes shops or some balmy thing like that and we were all thinking that if we are going to have to open a shop let’s open something we’re interested in and we went through all these different ideas about this that and the other paul had a nice idea about opening up white houses where we would sell white china and things like that everything white because you can never get anything white you know which was pretty groovy and it didn’t end up with that it ended up with apple and all this junk and the fool and all those stupid clothes and all that  i don’t know he’s still in london  i think some of his stuff actually has come true but they just haven’t been manufactured–maybe one of them is a salable object he was just another guy who comes and goes around people like us he’s all right but he’s cracked you know  i don’t know i was controlling the scene at the time i mean i was the one going in the office and shouting about paul had done it for six months and then i walked in and changed everything there were all the peter browns reporting behind my back to paul saying you know john’s doing this and john’s doing that that john he’s crazy i was always the one that must be crazy because i wouldn’t let them have status quo  no we read it in the papers that was when we started events i learned events from yoko we made everything into events from then on and got rid of it  i’d been planning on it for over a year and a bit i was waiting for a time to do it  that’s the truth  i don’t know what it was  yes i do well we always had we always kept them on their toes during our events period i don’t know but we said we had some other surprise for them later i can’t remember what it was  i didn’t really want to talk about all this go on  well we’re halfway through it now so let’s do it  yes  i said to paul i’m leaving  no i wasn’t angry  no i wasn’t angry–shit he’s a good pr man that’s all he’s about the best in the world probably he really does a job i wasn’t angry we were all hurt that he didn’t tell us that was what he was going to do  i was cursing because i hadn’t done it i wanted to do it i should have done it ah damn shit what a fool i was but there were many pressures at that time with the northern songs fight going on; it would have upset the whole thing if i would have said that  sure i did he’s another one of those people who think they made us they didn’t i’d like to hear dick james’ music and i’d like to hear george martin’s music please just play me some dick james actually has said that  that he made us people are under a delusion that they made us when in fact we made them  he didn’t tell us he did it it was just a fait accompli he went and sold his thing to lew grade that’s all we knew we read it in the paper i think  oh it was fantastic it was like this room full of old men smoking and fighting it’s great people seem to think that businessmen like allen or grade or any of them are a race apart they play the game the way we play music and it’s something to see they play a game first they have a ritual then they create allen he’s a very creative guy you know he creates situations which create positions for them to move in they all do it you know and it’s a sight to see we played our part we both did  with the bankers and things like that i think allen could tell you better because i don’t know everything seems as though it’s going to be trouble like you can’t say anything about anybody because you’re going to get sued or something like that allen will tell you what we did  how do you describe the job you know you know my job–i maneuver people that’s what leaders do and i sit and make situations which will be of benefit to me with other people it’s as simple as that i had to do a job to get allen in apple i did a job so did yoko  oh god yoko don’t say that maneuvering is what it is let’s not be coy about it it is a deliberate and thought-out maneuver of how to get a situation the way we want it that’s how life’s about isn’t it is it not  instinctive doesn’t isn’t dick james–so is lew grade–they’re all instinctive so is he if it’s instinctive–but it’s maneuvering there’s nothing ashamed about it we all do it it’s just owning up you know not going around saying god bless you brother pretending there is no vested interest  that’s not the thing the point i’m talking about is creating a situation around apple and the beatles in which allen could come in that is what i’m talking about and he wouldn’t have gotten in unless i’d done it and he wouldn’t have gotten in unless you’d done it you made the decision too  the same as i get anything i want the same as you get what you want i’m not telling you; just work at it get on the phone a little word here and a little word there and do it  you see a lot of people like the dick james derek taylors and peter browns all of them they think they’re the beatles and neil and all of them well i say fuck ‘em you know and after working with genius for ten years they begin to think they’re it they’re not  yes if there is such a thing as one i am one  when i was about  i used to think i must be a genius but nobody’s noticed i used to wonder whether i’m a genius or i’m not which is it i used to think well i can’t be mad because nobody’s put me away therefore i’m a genius a genius is a form of madness and we’re all that way you know and i used to be a bit coy about it like my guitar playing  i didn’t mention mal i said neil peter brown and derek they live in a dream of beatle past and everything they do is oriented to that they also have a warped view of what was happening i suppose we all do  well they have to grow up then they’ve only had half their life and they’ve got another whole half to go; and they can’t go on pretending to be beatles that’s where it’s at i mean when they read this they’ll think it’s cracked john if it’s in the article but that’s where it’s at they live in the past  they despised her  yes they insulted her and they still do they don’t even know i can see it and even when it’s written down it will look like i’m just paranoiac or she’s paranoiac i know just by the way the publicity on us was handled in apple all of the two years we were together and the attitude of people to us and the bits we hear from office girls we know so they can go stuff themselves  we were in our own dream but they’re the kind of idiots that really think that yoko split the beatles or allen it’s the same joke really they are that insane about allen too  yeah well if there is a god we’re all it  there is a guy in england william mann who was the first intellectual who reviewed the beatles in the times and got people talking about us in that intellectual way he wrote about aeolian cadences and all sorts of musical terms and he is a bullshitter but he made us credible with intellectuals he wrote about paul’s last album as if it were written by beethoven or something he’s still writing the same shit but it did us a lot of good in that way because people in all the middle classes and intellectuals were all going oooh  it’s the same you can quote paul it’s probably in the papers he said it many times at first he hated yoko and then he got to like her but it’s too late for me i’m for yoko why should she take that kind of shit from those people they were writing about her looking miserable in the let it be film but you sit through sessions with the most bigheaded up-tight people on earth and see what its fuckin’ like and be insulted– just because you love someone – and george shit insulted her right to her face in the apple office at the beginning just being ‘straight-forward’ you know that game of ‘i’m going to be up front’ because this is what we’ve heard and dylan and a few people said she’d got a lousy name in new york and you give off bad vibes that’s what george said to her! and we both sat through it i didn’t hit him i don’t know why  about what to do and all of that like you tell us guru probably after acid maybe after rubber soul i can’t remember it exactly happening we just took that position i mean we started putting out messages like the word is love and things like that i write messages you know see when you start putting out messages people start asking you what’s the message  a dentist in london laid it on george me and wives without telling us at a dinner party at his house he was a friend of george’s and our dentist at the time and he just put it in our coffee or something he didn’t know what it was; it’s all the same thing with that sort of middle class london swinger or whatever they had all heard about it and they didn’t know it was different from pot or pills and they gave us it he said i advise you not to leave and we all thought he was trying to keep us for an orgy in his house and we didn’t want to know and we went to the ad lib and these discotheques and there were these incredible things going on  i was pretty stoned for a month or two the second time we had it was in la we were on tour in one of those houses doris day’s house or wherever it was we used to stay and the three of us took it ringo george and i maybe neil and a couple of the byrds–what’s his name the one in the stills and nash thing crosby and the other guy who used to do the lead mcguinn i think they came i’m not sure on a few trips but there was a reporter don short we were in the garden it was only our second one and we still didn’t know anything about doing it in a nice place and cool it then they saw the reporter and thought how do we act we were terrified waiting for him to go and he wondered why we couldn’t come over neil who never had acid either had taken it and he would have to play road manager and we said go get rid of don short and he didn’t know what to do  it went on for years i must of had a thousand trips  a thousand i used to just eat it all the time i never took it in the studio once i thought i was taking some uppers and i was not in the state of handling it i can’t remember what album it was but i took it and i just noticed i suddenly got so scared on the mike i thought i felt ill and i thought i was going to crack i said i must get some air they all took me upstairs on the roof and george martin was looking at me funny and then it dawned on me i must have taken acid i said well i can’t go on you’ll have to do it and i’ll just stay and watch you know i got very nervous just watching them all i was saying is it all right and they were saying yeah they had all been very kind and they carried on making the record  george did in la the second time we took it paul felt very out of it because we are all a bit slightly cruel sort of we’re taking it and you’re not but we kept seeing him you know we couldn’t eat our food i just couldn’t manage it just picking it up with our hands there were all these people serving us in the house and we were knocking food on the floor and all of that it was a long time before paul took it then there was the big announcement  so i think george was pretty heavy on it; we are probably the most cracked paul is a bit more stable than george and i  i don’t know about straight stable i think lsd profoundly shocked him and ringo i think maybe they regret it  i had many jesus christ i stopped taking it because of that i just couldn’t stand it  it got like that but then i stopped it for i don’t know how long and then i started taking it again just before i met yoko derek came over and you see i got the message that i should destroy my ego and i did you know i was reading that stupid book of leary’s; we were going through a whole game that everybody went through and i destroyed myself i was slowly putting myself together round about maharishi time bit by bit over a two-year period i had destroyed me ego  a hard day’s night i was on pills that’s drugs that’s bigger drugs than pot started on pills when i was  no since i was  since i became a musician the only way to survive in hamburg to play eight hours a night was to take pills the waiters gave you them–the pills and drink i was a fucking dropped-down drunk in art school help was where we turned on to pot and we dropped drink simple as that i’ve always needed a drug to survive the others too but i always had more more pills more of everything because i’m more crazy probably  yes  it was only another mirror it wasn’t a miracle it was more of a visual thing and a therapy looking at yourself a bit it did all that you know i don’t quite remember but it didn’t write the music neither did janov or maharishi in the same terms i write the music in the circumstances in which i’m in whether its on acid or in the water  the story wasn’t bad but it could have been better another illusion was that we were just puppets and that these great people like brian epstein and dick lester created the situation and made this whole fuckin’ thing and precisely because we were what we were realistic we didn’t want to make a fuckin’ shitty pop movie we didn’t want to make a movie that was going to be bad and we insisted on having a real writer to write it  it was a good projection of one facade of us which was on tour once in london and once in dublin it was of us in that situation together in a hotel having to perform before people we were like that the writer saw the press conference  can you tell me whether that white album with the drawing by voorman on it was that before rubber soul or after  no maybe the others do i don’t remember those kind of things because it doesn’t mean anything it’s all gone  we were just getting better technically and musically that’s all finally we took over the studio in the early days we had to take what we were given we didn’t know how you can get more bass we were learning the technique on rubber soul we were more precise about making the album that’s all and we took over the cover and everything  that was paul’s title it was like yer blues i suppose meaning english soul i suppose just a pun there is no great mysterious meaning behind all of this it was just four boys working out what to call a new album  it was written in [london] sunday times sort of fab form and no home truths was written my auntie knocked out all the truth bits from my childhood and my mother and i allowed it which was my cop-out etcetera there was nothing about orgies and the shit that happened on tour i wanted a real book to come out but we all had wives and didn’t want to hurt their feelings end of that one because they still have wives  wherever we went there was always a whole scene going we had our four separate bedrooms we tried to keep them out of our room derek’s and neil’s rooms were always full of junk and whores and who-the-fuck-knows-what and policemen with it satyricon! we had to do something what do you do when the pill doesn’t wear off and it’s time to go i used to be up all night with derek whether there was anybody there or not i could never sleep such a heavy scene it was they didn’t call them groupies then they called it something else and if we couldn’t get groupies we would have whores and everything whatever was going  derek and neil that was their job and mal but i’m not going into all that  when we hit town we hit it there was no pissing about there’s photographs of me crawling about in amsterdam on my knees coming out of whore houses and things like that the police escorted me to the places because they never wanted a big scandal you see i don’t really want to talk about it because it will hurt yoko and it’s not fair suffice to say that they were satyricon on tour and that’s it because i don’t want to hurt their feelings or the other people’s girls either it’s just not fair  right right exactly  yes we didn’t have an affair though fuck knows what was said i was pretty close to brian if somebody is going to manage me i want to know them inside out he told me he was a fag  that i don’t know because i can’t remember it there is a better book on the beatles by michael brown love me do that was a true book he wrote how we were which was bastards you can’t be anything else in such a pressurized situation and we took it out on people like neil derek and mal that’s why underneath their facade they resent us but they can never show it and they won’t believe it when they read it they took a lot of shit from us because we were in such a shitty position it was hard work and somebody had to take it those things are left out by davies about what bastards we were fuckin’ big bastards that’s what the beatles were you have to be a bastard to make it that’s a fact and the beatles are the biggest bastards on earth  everybody wants the image to carry on you want to carry on the press around too because they want the free drinks and the free whores and the fun; everybody wants to keep on the bandwagon we were the caesars; who was going to knock us when there were a million pounds to be made all the handouts the bribery the police all the fucking hype everybody wanted in that’s why some of them are still trying to cling on to this don’t take rome from us not a portable rome where we can all have our houses and our cars and our lovers and our wives and office girls and parties and drink and drugs don’t take it from us otherwise you’re mad john you’re crazy silly john wants to take this all away  when we came down we were treated like real provincials by the londoners we were in fact provincials  that was a great period we were like kings of the jungle then and we were very close to the stones i don’t know how close the others were but i spent a lot of time with brian and mick i admire them you know i dug them the first time i saw them in whatever that place is they came from richmond i spent a lot of time with them and it was great we all used to just go around london in cars and meet each other and talk about music with the animals and eric and all that it was really a good time that was the best period fame-wise we didn’t get mobbed so much it was like a men’s smoking club just a very good scene  well he was different over the years as he disintegrated he ended up the kind of guy that you dread when he would come on the phone because you knew it was trouble he was really in a lot of pain in the early days he was all right because he was young and confident he was one of them guys that disintegrated in front of you he wasn’t sort of brilliant or anything he was just a nice guy  by then i didn’t feel anything i just thought another victim of the drug scene  i think it’s a lot of hype i like honky tonk woman but i think mick’s a joke with all that fag dancing i always did i enjoy it i’ll probably go and see his films and all like everybody else but really i think it’s a joke  no i never do see him we saw a bit of each other around when allen was first coming in–i think mick got jealous i was always very respectful about mick and the stones but he said a lot of sort of tarty things about the beatles which i am hurt by because you know i can knock the beatles but don’t let mick jagger knock them i would like to just list what we did and what the stones did two months after on every fuckin’ album every fuckin’ thing we did mick does exactly the same–he imitates us and i would like one of you fuckin’ underground people to point it out you know satanic majesties is pepper we love you it’s the most fuckin’ bullshit that’s all you need is love  yeah yeah and rubber soul too and revolver  i don’t remember it did it pan it  i don’t remember in those days reviews weren’t very important because we had it made whatever happened nowadays i’m as sensitive as shit but those days we were too big to touch i don’t remember the reviews at all i never read them we were so blasé we never even read the news clippings it was a bore to read about us i don’t even remember ever hearing about that review  yeah but there are two ways of thinking they are out to get us or it just happened that way after i started two virgins and doing those kind of things it seemed like i was fair game for the police there was some myth about us being protected because we had an mbe i don’t think that it was true it was just that we never did anything the way paul said the acid thing i never got attacked for it i don’t know whether that was protection because it was openly admitting that we had drugs i just think nobody really bothered about us  i can be but i don’t wish to be there is no reason on earth why i should be without her there is nothing more important than our relationship nothing we dig being together all the time and both of us could survive apart but what for i’m not going to sacrifice love real love for any fuckin’ whore or any friend or any business because in the end you’re alone at night neither of us want to be and you can’t fill the bed with groupies i don’t want to be a swinger like i said in the song i’ve been through it all and nothing works better than to have somebody you love hold you  i said a lot of things i write songs because that’s the thing i chose to do and i can’t help writing them that’s a fact sometimes i felt as though you worked to justify your existence but you don’t; you work to exist and vice versa and that’s it really  yeah creating is a result of pain too i have to put it somewhere and i write songs but when i was hiding in weybridge i used to think i wasn’t working there i made or movies just mm stuff but still movies and many many hours of tape of different sounds just not rocking i suppose you would call them avant-grade that’s how yoko met me there were very few people i could play those tapes to and i played them to her and then we made two virgins a few hours later  i think i’ll be able to control meself control is the wrong word i just won’t get involved in too many things that’s all i’ll just do whatever happens it’s silly to feel guilty that i’m not working that i’m not doing this or that it’s just stupid i’m just going to do what i want for meself and for both of us  because i’m sick of all these aggressive hippies or whatever they are the now generation being very up-tight with me either on the street or anywhere or on the phone demanding my attention as if i owed them something  i don’t know what i thought when it happened a lot of the things he says are true he is a child of the state made by us and he took their children it when nobody else would of course he’s cracked all right  he’s balmy like any other beatle-kind of fan who reads mysticism into it we used to have a laugh about this that or the other in a light-hearted way and some intellectual would read us some symbolic youth generation wants to see something in it we also took seriously some parts of the role but i don’t know what helter skelter has to do with knifing somebody i’ve never listened to the words properly it was just a noise  that’s bullshit i just read that one about dylan too that’s bullshit  i don’t know where that started that’s balmy you know as much about it as me  no that was bullshit the whole thing was made up we wouldn’t do anything like that we did put in like tit tit tit in girl and many things i don’t remember like a beat missing or something like that could be interpreted like that some people have got nothing better to do than study bibles and make myths about it and study rocks and make stories about how people used to live it’s just something for them to do they live vicariously  no we decided that if we were going to do anything like get married or like this film we are going to make now that we would dedicate it to peace and the concept of peace during that period because we are what we are it evolved that somehow we ended up being responsible to produce peace even in our own heads we would get that way that’s how it is peace is still important and my life is dedicated to living–just surviving is what it’s about–really from day to day  i don’t know i can’t measure it somebody else has to tell us what the reaction is  hamrick was brought over by tony because he said this was a great doctor–he hadn’t mentioned the flying saucers until he was on his way–and he was going to hypnotize us so we would stop smoking  we thought great tony said it really worked because it worked on him and it was easy so this big guy comes in who seemed to be primaling all the time–he was always crying a lot and talking–and then he tried it and it didn’t work he talked like crackers and then he said he would put us back into our past life we were game for anything then it’s like going to a fortune teller–so we said all right do it  whatever we make it if we want to go bullshitting off into intellectualism with rock and roll then we are going to get bullshitting rock intellectualism if we want real rock and roll it’s up to all of us to create it and stop being hyped by the revolutionary image and long hair we’ve got to get over that bit that’s what cutting hair is about let’s own up now and see who’s who who is doing something about what and who is making music and who is laying down bullshit rock and roll will be whatever we make it  because the best stuff is primitive enough and has no bullshit it gets through to you it’s beat go to the jungle and they have the rhythm it goes throughout the world and it’s as simple as that you get the rhythm going because everybody goes into it i read that eldridge cleaver said that blacks gave the middle class whites back their bodies and put their minds and bodies together something like that it gets through; it got through to me the only thing to get through to me of all the things that were happening when i was  rock and roll then was real everything else was unreal the thing about rock and roll good rock and roll–whatever good means and all that shit–is that it’s real and realism gets through to you despite yourself you recognize something in it which is true like all true art whatever art is readers ok if it’s real it’s simple usually and if it’s simple it’s true something like that rock and roll finally got through to yoko  if somebody starts playing that intellectual on me i’m going to start thinking i’m a very shy person; if somebody attacks i shrink yoko is an intellectual a supreme intellectual so i really know what i’m talking about; they have to have sort of a math formula  well it will never be as new and it will never again do what it did to me then but like tutti fruitti or long tall sally is pretty avant garde a friend of yoko’s in the village was talking about dylan and the one note as though he just discovered it that’s about as far out as you can get  it means a lot of things there is not one thing that’s beatle music how can they talk about it like that what is beatle music walrus or penny lane which it’s too diverse i want to hold your hand or revolution number nine  we didn’t sound like everybody else we didn’t sound like the black musicians because we weren’t black and we were brought up on an entirely different type of music and atmosphere so please please me and from me to you and all of those were our version of the chair we were building our own chairs that’s all and they were sort of local chairs  it was awful i hated it some of them were good but i didn’t like hollywood bowl some of those big gigs were good but not many of them  yeah i liked it because it was a slightly new sound at the time but it’s not my favorite song  it was pretty fuckin’ heavy for then it’s a heavy record that’s why i like it i used to like guitars  i am the walrus was originally the b side of hello goodbye! i was still in my love cloud with yoko and i thought well i’ll just say something nice to paul it’s all right you did a good job over these few years holding us together he was trying to organize the group and organize the music and be an individual and all that so i wanted to thank him i said the walrus is paul for that reason i felt well he can have it i’ve got yoko and thank you you can have the credit  i liked the a side but i never liked that sort of pop opera on the other side i think it’s junk because it was just bits of songs thrown together come together is all right that’s all i remember that was my song it was a competent album like rubber soul it was together in that way but abbey road had no life in it  it was great i wrote it in the morning on the piano i went to the office and sang it many times so i said hell let’s do it and we booked the studio and phil came in and said how do you want it i said you know ’s he said right and boom i did it in about three goes or something like that i went in and he played it back and there it was the only argument was that i said a bit more bass that’s all; and off we went  oh some time or other there was a period when we started realizing that you could go and remix it yourself we started listening to them and started saying well why can’t you do that we’d be just standing by the board saying well what about that and george martin would say well how do you like this in the early days they just would present us with finished product we would ask what happened to the bass or something and they would say oh that’s how it is you can’t that kind of thing it must have been a gradual thing  as a record  the record was beautiful  that is what it is for you know i remember hearing them all sing it–i don’t know whether it was on the radio or tv–it was a very big moment for me that’s what the song was about  it’s really just revolutionary i think its concept is revolutionary and i hope it’s for workers and not for tarts and fags i hope it’s what give peace a chance was about but i don’t know on the other hand it might just be ignored  i keep thinking mother is a commercial record because all the time i was writing it it was the one i was singing the most it’s the one that seemed to catch on in my head i’m convinced that mother is a commercial record  you agree well thank you but you said god  they’re all playing god or isolation  it’s the politics in it too politics will prepare the ground for my album same as my sweet lord prepared the ground for george’s i’m not going to get hits just like that; people are not just going to buy my album just because rolling stone liked it or because they’re going to play it tonight or because pete’s a good pusher people have got to be hyped in a way they’ve got to have it presented to them in all the best ways that are possible maybe love is the best way i like the song love; i like the melody and the words and everything i think its beautiful but i’m more of a rocker i originally conceived of mother and love as being a single but now i think that mother is too heavy maybe allen’s right love will do me more good  i’m opening a door for john lennon not for music or for the beatles or for anybody or anything  the implications are all money–all of it is money man they’ve been hinting around they’ve been saying well now this looks like a john lennon album not plastic ono well to me it’s plastic ono or i wouldn’t put it out like that  how quick do you get to number one the thing is love would attract more people because of the message man! there are many many people who would not like mother it hurts them the first thing that happens to you when you get the album is you can’t take it everybody’s reacted exactly the same they think fuck that’s how everybody is the second time they start saying oh there’s a little so if i laid mother on them it confirms the suspicion that something nasty is going on with that john lennon and his broad again  the ones on which i play guitar i wrote on guitar; the ones on which i play piano i wrote on piano  because i can play the piano even worse than i play the guitar–a limited palette as they call it–i surprise myself i have to think in terms of going from c to a and i’m not quite sure where i am half the time when i’m holding a chord on the guitar it’s only a sixth or seventh or something like that; on the piano i don’t know what it is it’s got that kind of feel about it i know such a lot about the guitar that with it i can be buskin’; if i want to write just a rocker i have to play guitar because i can’t play piano well enough to inspire me to rock that’s the difference really  ever the one best song  i don’t know if somebody asked me what is my favorite song is it stardust or something i can’t answer that kind of decision-making i can’t do i always liked walrus strawberry fields help in my life those are some favorites  because i meant it–it’s real the lyric is as good now as it was then it is no different and it makes me feel secure to know that i was that aware of myself then it was just me singing help and i meant it  no that’s just the ones i happen to like i like to read other people’s lyrics too  it was another one like magical mystery tour in a nutshell it was time for another beatle movie or something; paul wanted us to go on the road or do something he sort of set it up and there were discussions about where to go and all of that i had yoko by them and i would just tag along i was stoned all the time and i just didn’t give a shit nobody did it was just like it was in the movie; when i got to do across the universe  paul yawns and plays boogie i merely say anyone want to do a fast one that’s how i am year after year that begins to wear you down  oh fuckin’ god knows how long paul had this idea that he was going to rehearse us he’s looking for perfection all the time and had these ideas that we would rehearse and then make the album we being lazy fuckers–and we’d been playing for years! we’re grown men for fuck’s sake and we’re not going to sit around and rehearse i’m not anyway –we couldn’t get into it  the tape ended up like the bootleg version we didn’t want to know about it anymore so we just left it to glyn johns and said here mix it that was the first time since the first album that we didn’t want to have anything to do with it none of us could be bothered going in nobody called anybody about it and the tapes were left there glyn johns did it we got an acetate in the mail and we called each other and said what do you think  there were so many clashes it did come out at the same time or something didn’t it i think he wanted to show he was the beatles  very i expected just a little more if paul and i are sort of disagreeing and i feel weak i think he must feel strong you know that’s in an argument not that we’ve had much physical argument you know  i think it’ll probably scare him into doing something decent and then he’ll scare me into doing something decent like that  that was our version of what was happening people were sort of touching us as we walked past that kind of thing wherever we went we were supposed to be not like normal and we were supposed to put up with all sorts of shit from lord mayors and their wives be touched and pawed like hard day’s night only a million more times like at the american embassy or the british embassy in washington here or wherever it was when some bloody animal cut ringo’s hair i walked out of that swearing at all of them i’d forgotten but you tripped me off into that one what was the question  wherever we went on tour in britain and everywhere we went there were always a few seats laid aside for cripples and people in wheelchairs because we were famous we were supposed to have epileptics and whatever they are in our dressing room all the time we were supposed to be sort of good and really you wanted to be alone you don’t know what to say because they’re usually saying i’ve got your record or they can’t speak and just want to touch you it’s always the mother or the nurse pushing them on you they themselves would just say hello and go away but the mothers would push them at you like you were christ or something as if there were some aura about you which would rub off on them it just got to be like that and we were very sort of callous about it it was just dreadful you would open up every night and instead of seeing kids there you would just see a row full of cripples along the front it seemed that we were just surrounded by cripples and blind people all the time and when we would go through corridors they would be all touching us and things like that it was horrifying  yeah well as naive as in his own write  well i mean we knew what the game was  it was the in joke that we were supposed to cure them; it was the kind of thing that we would say because it was a cruel thing to say we felt sorry for them anybody would but there is a kind of embarrassment when you’re surrounded by blind deaf and crippled people there is only so much we could say you know with the pressure on us to do and to perform
