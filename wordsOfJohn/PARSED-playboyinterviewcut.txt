 i've been baking bread and looking after the baby  that's like what everyone else who has asked me that question over the last few years says 'but what else have you been doing' to which i say 'are you kidding' because bread and babies as every housewife knows is a full-time job after i made the loaves i felt like i had conquered something but as i watched the bread being eaten i thought well jesus don't i get a gold record or knighted or nothing  there were many reasons i had been under obligation or contract from the time i was until well into my s after all those years it was all i knew i wasn't free i was boxed in my contract was the physical manifestation of being in prison it was more important to face myself and face that reality than to continue a life of rock 'n' roll and to go up and down with the whims of either your own performance or the public's opinion of you rock 'n' roll was not fun anymore i chose not to take the standard options in my business going to vegas and singing your great hits if you're lucky or going to hell which is where elvis went  you get the big prize when you get cancer and you have been drawing circles and triangles for ten years i had become a craftsman and i could have continued being a craftsman i respect craftsmen but i am not interested in becoming one  yeah to churn them out because i was expected to like so many people who put out an album every six months because they're supposed to  not only paul but i had lost the initial freedom of the artist by becoming enslaved to the image of what the artist is supposed to do a lot of artists kill themselves because of it whether it is through drink like dylan thomas or through insanity like van gogh or through vd like gauguin  most people don't live with yoko ono  most people don't have a companion who will tell the truth and refuse to live with a bullshit artist which i am pretty good at i can bullshit myself and everybody around yoko that's my answer  she showed me the possibility of the alternative 'you don't have to do this' 'i don't really but-but-but-but-but' of course it wasn't that simple and it didn't sink in overnight it took constant reinforcement walking away is much harder than carrying on i've done both on demand and on schedule i had turned out records from to  walking away seemed like what the guys go through at  when suddenly they're supposed to not exist anymore and they're sent out of the office 'your life is over time for golf'  when i was cleaning the cat shit and feeding sean she was sitting in rooms full of smoke with men in three-piece suits that they couldn't button  we had to face the business it was either another case of asking some daddy to come solve our business or having one of us do it those lawyers were getting a quarter of a million dollars a year to sit around a table and eat salmon at the plaza most of them didn't seem interested in solving the problems every lawyer had a lawyer each beatle had four or five people working so we felt we had to look after that side of the business and get rid of it and deal with it before we could start dealing with our own life and the only one of us who has the talent or the ability to deal with it on that level is yoko  there was a bit of an attitude that this is john's wife but surely she can't really be representing him  they can't stand it but they have to stand it because she is who represents us they're all male you know just big and fat vodka lunch shouting males like trained dogs trained to attack all the time recently she made it possible for us to earn a large sum of money that benefited all of them and they fought and fought not to let her do it because it was her idea and she was a woman and she was not a professional but she did it and then one of the guys said to her 'well lennon does it again' but lennon didn't have anything to do with it  you breathe in and you breathe out we feel like doing it and we have something to say also yoko and i attempted a few times to make music together but that was a long time ago and people still had the idea that the beatles were some kind of sacred thing that shouldn't step outside its circle it was hard for us to work together then we think either people have forgotten or they have grown up by now so we can make a second foray into that place where she and i are together making music simply that it's not like i'm some wondrous mystic prince from the rock-'n'-roll world dabbling in strange music with this exotic oriental dragon lady which was the picture projected by the press before  that's ridiculous people always said john and yoko would do anything for the publicity in the newsweek article it says the reporter asked us 'why did you go underground' well she never asked it that way and i didn't go underground i just stopped talking to the press it got to be pretty funny i was calling myself greta hughes or howard garbo through that period but still the gossip items never stopped we never stopped being in the press but there seemed to be more written about us when we weren't talking to the press than when we were  we are both sensitive people and we were hurt a lot by it i mean we couldn't understand it when you're in love when somebody says something like 'how can you be with that woman' you say 'what do you mean i am with this goddess of love the fulfillment of my whole life why are you saying this why do you want to throw a rock at her or punish me for being in love with her' our love helped us survive it but some of it was pretty violent there were a few times when we nearly went under but we managed to survive and here we are thank you thank you thank you  well that's rubbish you know nobody controls me i'm uncontrollable the only one who controls me is me and that's just barely possible  listen if somebody's gonna impress me whether it be a maharishi or a yoko ono there comes a point when the emperor has no clothes there comes a point when i will see so for all you folks out there who think that i'm having the wool pulled over my eyes well that's an insult to me not that you think less of yoko because that's your problem what i think of her is what counts! because fuck you brother and sister you don't know what's happening i'm not here for you i'm here for me and her and the baby!  well you're always insulted my dear wife it's natural  she doesn't need me  she doesn't need a beatle who needs a beatle  but people do say that  they want to hold on to something they never had in the first place anybody who claims to have some interest in me as an individual artist or even as part of the beatles has absolutely misunderstood everything i ever said if they can't see why i'm with yoko and if they can't see that they don't see anything they're just jacking off to it could be anybody mick jagger or somebody else let them go jack off to mick jagger ok i don't need it  i absolutely don't need it let them chase wings just forget about me if that's what you want go after paul or mick i ain't here for that if that's not apparent in my past i'm saying it in black and green next to all the tits and asses on page  go play with the other boys don't bother me go play with the rolling wings  no wait a minute let's stay with this a second; sometimes i can't let go of it nobody ever said anything about paul's having a spell on me or my having one on paul! they never thought that was abnormal in those days two guys together or four guys together! why didn't they ever say 'how come those guys don't split up i mean what's going on backstage what is this paul and john business how can they be together so long' we spent more time together in the early days than john and yoko the four of us sleeping in the same room practically in the same bed in the same truck living together night and day eating shitting and pissing together! all right doing everything together! nobody said a damn thing about being under a spell maybe they said we were under the spell of brian epstein or george martin there's always somebody who has to be doing something to you you know they're congratulating the stones on being together years whoooopee! at least charlie and bill still got their families in the eighties they'll be asking 'why are those guys still together can't they hack it on their own why do they have to be surrounded by a gang is the little leader scared somebody's gonna knife him in the back' that's gonna be the question that's-a-gonna be the question! they're gonna look back at the beatles and the stones and all those guys as relics the days when those bands were just all men will be on the newsreels you know they will be showing pictures of the guy with lipstick wriggling his ass and the four guys with the evil black make-up on their eyes trying to look raunchy that's gonna be the joke in the future not a couple singing together or living and working together it's all right when you're   to have male companions and idols ok it's tribal and it's gang and it's fine but when it continues and you're still doing it when you're  that means you're still in the head  it was in in england i'd been told about this 'event' this japanese avant-garde artist coming from america i was looking around the gallery and i saw this ladder and climbed up and got a look in this spyglass on the top of the ladder you feel like a fool and it just said 'yes' now at the time all the avant-garde was smash the piano with a hammer and break the sculpture and anti- anti- anti- anti- anti it was all boring negative crap you know and just that yes made me stay in a gallery full of apples and nails there was a sign that said hammer a nail in so i said 'can i hammer a nail in' but yoko said no because the show wasn't opening until the next day but the owner came up and whispered to her 'let him hammer a nail in you know he's a millionaire he might buy it' and so there was this little conference and finally she said 'ok you can hammer a nail in for five shillings' so smartass says 'well i'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in' and that's when we really met that's when we locked eyes and she got it and i got it and as they say in all the interviews we do the rest is history  of course i was a beatle but things had begun to change in  just before we met i went to almeria spain to make the movie 'how i won the war' it did me a lot of good to get away i was there six weeks i wrote 'strawberry fields forever' there by the way it gave me time to think on my own away from the others from then on i was looking for somewhere to go but i didn't have the nerve to really step out on the boat by myself and push it off but when i fell in love with yoko i knew my god this is different from anything i've ever known this is something other this is more than a hit record more than gold more than everything it is indescribable  as i said i had already begun to want to leave but when i met yoko is like when you meet your first woman you leave the guys at the bar you don't go play football anymore you don't go play snooker or billiards maybe some guys do it on friday night or something but once i found the woman the boys became of no interest whatsoever other than being old school friends 'those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine' we got married three years later in  that was the end of the boys and it just so happened that the boys were well known and weren't just local guys at the bar everybody got so upset over it there was a lot of shit thrown at us a lot of hateful stuff  yoko do you still have to carry that cross that was years ago  i've always thought there was this underlying thing in paul's 'get back' when we were in the studio recording it every time he sang the line 'get back to where you once belonged' he'd look at yoko  no but maybe he'll say i'm paranoid  do you want to go back to high school why should i go back ten years to provide an illusion for you that i know does not exist it cannot exist  why should the beatles give more didn't they give everything on god's earth for ten years didn't they give themselves you're like the typical sort of love-hate fan who says 'thank you for everything you did for us in the sixties would you just give me another shot just one more miracle'  when rodgers worked with hart and then worked with hammerstein do you think he should have stayed with one instead of working with the other should dean martin and jerry lewis have stayed together because i used to like them together what is this game of doing things because other people want it the whole beatle idea was to do what you want right to take your own responsibility  i don't the beatles you see i'm too involved in them artistically i cannot see them objectively i cannot listen to them objectively i'm dissatisfied with every record the beatles ever fucking made there ain't one of them i wouldn't remake including all the beatles records and all my individual ones so i cannot possibly give you an assessment of what the beatles are when i was a beatle i thought we were the best fucking group in the god-damned world and believing that is what made us what we were whether we call it the best rock 'n roll group or the best pop group or whatever but you play me those tracks today and i want to remake every damn one of them there's not a single one i heard 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' on the radio last night it's abysmal you know the track is just terrible i mean it's great but it wasn't made right know what i mean but that's the artistic trip isn't it that's why you keep going but to get back to your original question about the beatles and their music the answer is that we did some good stuff and we did some bad stuff  'imagine' 'love' and those plastic ono band songs stand up to any song that was written when i was a beatle now it may take you or years to appreciate that but the fact is if you check those songs out you will see that it is as good as any fucking stuff that was ever done  well if it was the best so what  it can never be again! everyone always talks about a good thing coming to an end as if life was over but i'll be when this interview comes out paul is  elton john bob dylan we're all relatively young people the game isn't over yet everyone talks in terms of the last record or the last beatle concert but god willing there are another years of productivity to go i'm not judging whether 'i am the walrus' is better or worse than 'imagine' it is for others to judge i am doing it i do i don't stand back and judge i do  wouldn't it be interesting to take elvis back to his sun records period i don't know but i'm content to listen to his sun records i don't want to dig him up out of the grave the beatles don't exist and can never exist again john lennon paul mccartney george harrison and richard starkey could put on a concert but it can never be the beatles singing 'strawberry fields' or 'i am the walrus' again because we are not in our s we cannot be that again nor can the people who are listening  i never went to high school reunions my thing is out of sight out of mind that's my attitude toward life so i don't have any romanticism about any part of my past i think of it only inasmuch as it gave me pleasure or helped me grow psychologically that is the only thing that interests me about yesterday i don't believe in yesterday by the way you know i don't believe in yesterday i am only interested in what i am doing now  if they didn't understand the beatles and the sixties then what the fuck could we do for them now do we have to divide the fish and the loaves for the multitudes again do we have to get crucified again do we have to do the walking on water again because a whole pile of dummies didn't see it the first time or didn't believe it when they saw it you know that's what they're asking 'get off the cross i didn't understand the first bit yet can you do that again' no way you can never go home it doesn't exist  well i heard some beatles stuff on the radio the other day and i heard 'green onion' no 'glass onion' i don't even know my own songs! i listened to it because it was a rare track  yeah that line was a joke you know that line was put in partly because i was feeling guilty because i was with yoko and i knew i was finally high and dry in a perverse way i was sort of saying to paul 'here have this crumb have this illusion have this stroke because i'm leaving you' anyway it's a song they don't usually play when a radio station has a beatles weekend they usually play the same ten songs 'a hard day's night' 'help!' 'yesterday' 'something' 'let it be' you know there's all that wealth of material but we hear only ten songs so the deejay says 'i want to thank john paul george and ringo for not getting back together and spoiling a good thing' i thought it was a good sign maybe people are catching on  oh yeah paul and i were together watching that show he was visiting us at our place in the dakota we were watching it and almost went down to the studio just as a gag we nearly got into a cab but we were actually too tired  that was a period when paul just kept turning up at our door with a guitar i would let him in but finally i said to him 'please call before you come over it's not and turning up at the door isn't the same anymore you know just give me a ring' he was upset by that but i didn't mean it badly i just meant that i was taking care of a baby all day and some guy turns up at the door but anyway back on that night he and linda walked in and he and i were just sitting there watching the show and we went 'ha-ha wouldn't it be funny if we went down' but we didn't  yes but i didn't mean it like that  we're neither i haven't seen any of the beatles for i don't know how much time somebody asked me what i thought of paul's last album and i made some remark like i thought he was depressed and sad but then i realized i hadn't listened to the whole damn thing i heard one track the hit 'coming up' which i thought was a good piece of work then i heard something else that sounded like he was depressed but i don't follow their work i don't follow wings you know i don't give a shit what wings is doing or what george's new album is doing or what ringo is doing i'm not interested no more than i am in what elton john or bob dylan is doing it's not callousness it's just that i'm too busy living my own life to be following what other people are doing whether they're the beatles or guys i went to college with or people i had intense relationships with before i met the beatles  i kind of admire the way paul started back from scratch forming a new band and playing in small dance halls because that's what he wanted to do with the beatles he wanted us to go back to the dance halls and experience that again but i didn't that was one of the problems in a way that he wanted to relive it all or something i don't know what it was but i kind of admire the way he got off his pedestal now he's back on it again but i mean he did what he wanted to do that's fine but it's just not what i wanted to do  'the long and winding road' was the last gasp from him although i really haven't listened  really talked to him no that's the operative word i haven't really talked to him in ten years because i haven't spent time with him i've been doing other things and so has he you know he's got kids and about  records out how can he spend time talking he's always working  well you could say that he provided a lightness an optimism while i would always go for the sadness the discords a certain bluesy edge there was a period when i thought i didn't write melodies that paul wrote those and i just wrote straight shouting rock 'n roll but of course when i think of some of my own songs 'in my life' or some of the early stuff 'this boy' i was writing melody with the best of them paul had a lot of training could play a lot of instruments he'd say 'well why don't you change that there you've done that note times in the song' you know i'll grab a note and ram it home then again i'd be the one to figure out where to go with a song a story that paul would start in a lot of the songs my stuff is the middle-eight the bridge  take 'michelle' paul and i were staying somewhere and he walked in and hummed the first few bars with the words you know-- and he says 'where do i go from here' i'd been listening to blues singer nina simone who did something like 'i love you!' in one of her songs and that made me think of the middle-eight for 'michelle' 'i love you i love you i lo-ove you'  i always had an easier time with lyrics though paul is quite a capable lyricist who doesn't think he is so he doesn't go for it rather than face the problem he would avoid it 'hey jude' is a damn good set of lyrics i made no contribution to the lyrics there and a couple of lines he has come up with show indications of a good lyricist but he just hasn't taken it anywhere still in the early days we didn't care about lyrics as long as the song had some vague theme she loves you he loves him they all love each other it was the hook line and sound we were going for that's still my attitude but i can't leave lyrics alone i have to make them make sense apart from the songs  in 'we can work it out' paul did the first half i did the middle-eight but you've got paul writing 'we can work it out/we can work it out' --real optimistic y' know and me impatient 'life is very short and there's no time/for fussing and fighting my friend'  sure well i was always like that you know i was like that before the beatles and after the beatles i always asked why people did things and why society was like it was i didn't just accept it for what it was apparently doing i always looked below the surface  yeah i was lying it was when i felt resentful so i felt that we did everything apart but actually a lot of the songs we did eyeball to eyeball  yeah 'sgt pepper' was paul's idea and i remember he worked on it a lot and suddenly called me to go into the studio said it was time to write some songs on 'pepper' under the pressure of only ten days i managed to come up with 'lucy in the sky' and 'day in the life' we weren't communicating enough you see and later on that's why i got resentful about all that stuff but now i understand that it was just the same competitive game going on  in the early days we'd make a record in hours or something; they would want a single every three months and we'd have to write it in a hotel room or in a van so the cooperation was functional as well as musical  i never actually felt a loss i don't want it to sound negative like i didn't need paul because when he was there obviously it worked but i can't it's easier to say what i gave to him than what he gave to me and he'd say the same  you know i wasn't really feeling that vicious at the time but i was using my resentment toward paul to create a song let's put it that way he saw that it pointedly refers to him and people kept hounding him about it but you know there were a few digs on his album before mine he's so obscure other people didn't notice them but i heard them i thought well i'm not obscure i just get right down to the nitty-gritty so he'd done it his way and i did it mine but as to the line you quoted yeah i think paul died creatively in a way  i don't know whether this will gel for you when the beatles played in america for the first time they played pure craftsmanship meaning they were already old hands the jism had gone out of the performances a long time ago in the same respect the songwriting creativity had left paul and me in the mid-sixties when we wrote together in the early days it was like the beginning of a relationship lots of energy in the 'sgt pepper'- 'abbey road' period the relationship had matured maybe had we gone on together more interesting things would have come but it couldn't have been the same  ringo was a star in his own right in liverpool before we even met he was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had ringo starr-time and he was in one of the top groups in britain but especially in liverpool before we even had a drummer so ringo's talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other i don't know what he would have ended up as but whatever that spark is in ringo that we all know but can't put our finger on whether it is acting drumming or singing i don't know there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the beatles ringo is a damn good drummer he is not technically good but i think ringo's drumming is underrated the same way paul's bass playing is underrated paul was one of the most innovative bass players ever and half the stuff that is going on now is directly ripped off from his beatles period he is an egomaniac about everything else about himself but his bass playing he was always a bit coy about i think paul and ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians not technically great none of us are technical musicians none of us could read music none of us can write it but as pure musicians as inspired humans to make the noise they are as good as anybody  i think 'all things must pass' was all right it just went on too long  well he walked right into it he knew what he was doing  he must have known you know he's smarter than that it's irrelevant actually only on a monetary level does it matter he could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him but he just let it go and paid the price maybe he thought god would just sort of let him off  well i was hurt by george's book 'i me mine' so this message will go to him he put a book out privately on his life that by glaring omission says that my influence on his life is absolutely zilch and nil in his book which is purportedly this clarity of vision of his influence on each song he wrote he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years i'm not in the book  because george's relationship with me was one of young follower and older guy he's three or four years younger than me it's a love/hate relationship and i think george still bears resentment toward me for being a daddy who left home he would not agree with this but that's my feeling about it i was just hurt i was just left out as if i didn't exist i don't want to be that egomaniacal but he was like a disciple of mine when we started i was already an art student when paul and george were still in grammar school there is a vast difference between being in high school and being in college and i was already in college and already had sexual relationships already drank and did a lot of things like that when george was a kid he used to follow me and my first girlfriend cynthia who became my wife around we'd come out of art school and he'd be hovering around like those kids at the gate of the dakota now i remember the day he called to ask for help on 'taxman' one of his bigger songs i threw in a few one-liners to help the song along because that's what he asked for he came to me because he couldn't go to paul because paul wouldn't have helped him at that period i didn't want to do it i thought oh no don't tell me i have to work on george's stuff it's enough doing my own and paul's but because i loved him and i didn't want to hurt him when he called me that afternoon and said 'will you help me with this song' i just sort of bit my tongue and said ok it had been john and paul so long he'd been left out because he hadn't been a songwriter up until then as a singer we allowed him only one track on each album if you listen to the beatles' first albums the english versions he gets a single track the songs he and ringo sang at first were the songs that used to be part of my repertoire in the dance halls i used to pick songs for them from my repertoire the easier ones to sing so i am slightly resentful of george's book but don't get me wrong i still love those guys the beatles are over but john paul george and ringo go on  'i'm the greatest' it was the muhammad ali line of course it was perfect for ringo to sing if i said 'i'm the greatest' they'd all take it so seriously no one would get upset with ringo singing it  yeah except when george and billy preston started saying 'let's form a group let's form a group' i was embarrassed when george kept asking me he was just enjoying the session and the spirit was very good but i was with yoko you know we took time out from what we were doing the very fact that they would imagine i would form a male group without yoko! it was still in their minds  i don't want to have anything to do with benefits i have been benefited to death  because they're always rip-offs i haven't performed for personal gain since  when the beatles last performed every concert since then yoko and i did for specific charities except for a toronto thing that was a rock 'n roll revival every one of them was a mess or a rip-off so now we give money to who we want you've heard of tithing  right i am just going to do it privately i am not going to get locked into that business of saving the world on stage the show is always a mess and the artist always comes off badly  bangladesh was ca-ca  yeah right i can't even talk about it because it's still a problem you'll have to check with mother because she knows the ins and outs of it i don't but it's all a rip-off so forget about it all of you who are reading this don't bother sending me all that garbage about 'just come and save the indians come and save the blacks come and save the war veterans' anybody i want to save will be helped through our tithing which is ten percent of whatever we earn  that was a commercial for sid bernstein written with jewish schmaltz and showbiz and tears dropping on one knee it was al jolson ok so i don't buy that ok  where do people get off saying the beatles should give $ to south america you know america has poured billions into places like that it doesn't mean a damn thing after they've eaten that meal then what it lasts for only a day after the $ is gone then what it goes round and round in circles you can pour money in forever after peru then harlem then britain there is no one concert we would have to dedicate the rest of our lives to one world concert tour and i'm not ready for it not in this lifetime anyway  we never admitted anything  what the post says ok so we are rich; so what  in england there are only two things to be basically you are either for the labor movement or for the capitalist movement either you become a right-wing archie bunker if you are in the class i am in or you become an instinctive socialist which i was that meant i think people should get their false teeth and their health looked after all the rest of it but apart from that i worked for money and i wanted to be rich so what the hell if that's a paradox then i'm a socialist but i am not anything what i used to be is guilty about money that's why i lost it either by giving it away or by allowing myself to be screwed by so-called managers  sean and i were away for a weekend and yoko came over to sell this cow and i was joking about it we hadn't seen her for days; she spent all her time on it but then i read the paper that said she sold it for a quarter of a million dollars only yoko could sell a cow for that much  they're good business  what would you suggest i do give everything away and walk the streets the buddhist says 'get rid of the possessions of the mind' walking away from all the money would not accomplish that it's like the beatles i couldn't walk away from the beatles that's one possession that's still tagging along right if i walk away from one house or houses i'm not gonna escape it  it takes time to get rid of all this garbage that i've been carrying around that was influencing the way i thought and the way i lived it had a lot to do with yoko showing me that i was still possessed i left physically when i fell in love with yoko but mentally it took the last ten years of struggling i learned everything from her  it is a teacher-pupil relationship that's what people don't understand she's the teacher and i'm the pupil i'm the famous one the one who's supposed to know everything but she's my teacher she's taught me everything i fucking know she was there when i was nowhere when i was the nowhere man she's my don juan that's what people don't understand i'm married to fucking don juan that's the hardship of it don juan doesn't have to laugh; don juan doesn't have to be charming; don juan just is and what goes on around don juan is irrelevant to don juan  no a don juan doesn't have a following a don juan isn't in the newspaper and doesn't have disciples and doesn't proselytize  when don juan said when don ono said 'get out! because you're not getting it' well it was like being sent into the desert and the reason she wouldn't let me back in was because i wasn't ready to come back in i had to settle things within myself when i was ready to come back in she let me back in and that's what i'm living with  yes we were separated in the early seventies she kicked me out suddenly i was on a raft alone in the middle of the universe  well at first i thought whoopee whoopee! you know bachelor life! whoopee! and then i woke up one day and i thought what is this i want to go home! but she wouldn't let me come home that's why it was months apart instead of six months we were talking all the time on the phone and i would say 'i don't like this i'm getting in trouble and i'd like to come home please' and she would say 'you're not ready to come home' so what do you say ok back to the bottle  she has her ways whether they be mystical or practical when she said it's not ready it ain't ready  i was just trying to hide what i felt in the bottle i was just insane it was the lost weekend that lasted months i've never drunk so much in my life i tried to drown myself in the bottle and i was with the heaviest drinkers in the business  such as harry nilsson bobby keyes keith moon we couldn't pull ourselves out we were trying to kill ourselves i think harry might still be trying poor bugger god bless you harry wherever you are but jesus you know i had to get away from that because somebody was going to die well keith did it was like who's going to die first unfortunately keith was the one  for me it was because of being apart i couldn't stand it they had their own reasons and it was let's all drown ourselves together from where i was sitting it looked like that let's kill ourselves but do it like errol flynn you know the macho male way it's embarrassing for me to think about that period because i made a big fool of myself but maybe it was a good lesson for me i wrote 'nobody loves you when you're down and out' during that time that's how i felt it exactly expresses the whole period for some reason i always imagined sinatra singing that one i don't know why it's kind of a sinatraesque song really he would do a perfect job with it are you listening frank you need a song that isn't a piece of nothing here's the one for you the horn arrangement and everything's made for you but don't ask me to produce it  the stories were all so exaggerated but we were all in a restaurant drinking not eating as usual at those gatherings and i happened to go take a pee and there was a brand-new fresh kotex not tampax on the toilet you know the old trick where you put a penny on your forehead and it sticks i was a little high and i just picked it up and slapped it on and it stayed you see i walked out of the bathroom and i had a kotex on my head big deal everybody went 'ha-ha-ha' and it fell off but the press blew it up  yoko looks upon men as assistants of varying degrees of intimacy but basically assistants and this one's going to take a pee  when yoko and i started doing stuff together we would hold press conferences and announce our whatevers we're going to wear bags or whatever and before this one press conference one beatle assistant in the upper echelon of beatle assistants leaned over to yoko and said you know you don't have to work you've got enough money now that you're mrs lennon' and when she complained to me about it i couldn't understand what she was talking about 'but this guy' i'd say 'he's just good old charley or whatever he's been with us years' the same kind of thing happened in the studio she would say to an engineer 'i'd like a little more treble a little more bass' or 'there's too much of whatever you're putting on' and they'd look at me and say 'what did you say john' those days i didn't even notice it myself now i know what she's talking about in japan when i ask for a cup of tea in japanese they look at yoko and ask 'he wants a cup of tea' in japanese  john-- john is the name  that's john j-o-h-n from johan i believe  she don't suffer fools gladly even if she's married to him  now get that editors you got that word  and we learned that it's better for the family if we are both working for the family she doing the business and me playing mother and wife we reordered our priorities the number-one priority is her and the family everything else revolves around that  only yoko was when she had sean  everybody else becomes a worker/consumer  too late they've got it on tape  big sister-- wait till she comes!  then it's aldous huxley  some of my best friends are organs  back to the album very good  we got back together decided this was our life that having a baby was important to us and that anything else was subsidiary to that we worked hard for that child we went through all hell trying to have a baby through many miscarriages and other problems he is what they call a love child in truth doctors told us we could never have a child we almost gave up 'well that's it then we can't have one' we were told something was wrong with my sperm that i abused myself so much in my youth that there was no chance yoko was  and so they said no way she has had too many miscarriages and when she was a young girl there were no pills so there were lots of abortions and miscarriages; her stomach must be like kew gardens in london no way but this chinese acupuncturist in san francisco said 'you behave yourself no drugs eat well no drink you have child in months' and we said 'but the english doctors said' he said 'forget what they said you have child' we had sean and sent the acupuncturist a polaroid of him just before he died god rest his soul  not because of her age but because of a screw-up in the hospital and the fucking price of fame somebody had made a transfusion of the wrong blood type into yoko i was there when it happened and she starts to go rigid and then shake from the pain and the trauma i run up to this nurse and say 'go get the doctor!' i'm holding on tight to yoko while this guy gets to the hospital room he walks in hardly notices that yoko is going through fucking convulsions goes straight for me smiles shakes my hand and says 'i've always wanted to meet you mr lennon i always enjoyed your music' i start screaming 'my wife's dying and you wanna talk about my music!' christ!  i haven't said anything beatles were never mentioned to him there was no reason to mention it; we never played beatle records around the house unlike the story that went around that i was sitting in the kitchen for the past five years playing beatle records and reliving my past like some kind of howard hughes he did see 'yellow submarine' at a friend's so i had to explain what a cartoon of me was doing in a movie  he doesn't differentiate between the beatles and daddy and mommy he thinks yoko was a beatle too i don't have beatle records on the jukebox he listens to he's more exposed to early rock 'n roll he's into 'hound dog' he thinks it's about hunting sean's not going to public school by the way we feel he can learn the three rs when he wants to or when the law says he has to i suppose i'm not going to fight it otherwise there's no reason for him to be learning to sit still i can't see any reason for it sean now has plenty of child companionship which everybody says is important but he also is with adults a lot he's adjusted to both the reason why kids are crazy is because nobody can face the responsibility of bringing them up everybody's too scared to deal with children all the time so we reject them and send them away and torture them the ones who survive are the conformists their bodies are cut to the size of the suits the ones we label good the ones who don't fit the suits either are put in mental homes or become artists  well cyn got possession or whatever you call it i got rights to see him on his holidays and all that business and at least there's an open line still going it's not the best relationship between father and son but it is there he's now julian and i will have a relationship in the future over the years he's been able to see through the beatle image and to see through the image that his mother will have given him subconsciously or consciously he's interested in girls and autobikes now i'm just sort of a figure in the sky but he's obliged to communicate with me even when he probably doesn't want to  i'm not going to lie to julian ninety percent of the people on this planet especially in the west were born out of a bottle of whiskey on a saturday night and there was no intent to have children so percent of us that includes everybody were accidents i don't know anybody who was a planned child all of us were saturday-night specials julian is in the majority along with me and everybody else sean is a planned child and therein lies the difference i don't love julian any less as a child he's still my son whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days he's here he belongs to me and he always will  it was a classic case of men being macho it turned into me and allen klein trying to dominate tony cox tony's attitude was 'you got my wife but you won't get my child' in this battle yoko and the child were absolutely forgotten i've always felt bad about it it became a case of the shoot-out at the ok corral cox fled to the hills and hid out and the sheriff and i tracked him down first we won custody in court yoko didn't want to go to court but the men klein and i did it anyway  we chased him all over the world god knows where he went so if you're reading this tony let's grow up about it it's gone we don't want to chase you anymore because we've done enough damage  it was like we were after an escaped convict  yoko got steamed into a guilt thing that if she wasn't attacking them with detectives and police and the fbi then she wasn't a good mother looking for her baby she kept saying 'leave them alone leave them alone' but they said you can't do that  i was just going to commit hara-kiri first  when she gets to be in her 's she'll understand that we were idiots and we know we were idiots she might give us a chance  i'll just half-kill myself  oh god it's all coming out  one rule for the men one for the women  but i've said a million hail marys what the hell else can i do  i am her favorite husband  well sometimes you know she'd come home and say 'i'm tired' i'd say only partly tongue in cheek what the fuck do you think i am i'm hours with the baby! do you think that's easy' i'd say 'you're going to take some more interest in the child' i don't care whether it's a father or a mother when i'm going on about pimples and bones and which tv shows to let him watch i would say 'listen this is important i don't want to hear about your $ deal tonight!' i would like both parents to take care of the children but 'how' is a different matter  it's true the saying 'you've come a long way baby' applies more to me than to her as harry nilsson says 'everything is the opposite of what it is isn't it' it's men who've come a long way from even contemplating the idea of equality but although there is this thing called the women's movement society just took a laxative and they've just farted they haven't really had a good shit yet the seed was planted sometime in the late sixties right but the real changes are coming i am the one who has come a long way i was the pig and it is a relief not to be a pig the pressures of being a pig were enormous i don't have any hankering to be looked upon as a sex object a male macho rock 'n roll singer i got over that a long time ago i'm not even interested in projecting that so i like it to be known that yes i looked after the baby and i made bread and i was a househusband and i am proud of it it's the wave of the future and i'm glad to be in on the forefront of that too  it did for this man but don't forget i'm the one who benefited the most from doing it now i can step back and say sean is going to be five years old and i was able to spend his first five years with him and i am very proud of that and come to think of it it looks like i'm going to be and life begins at -- so they promise and i believe it too i feel fine and i'm very excited it's like you know hitting  like 'wow what's going to happen next' only this time we're together  it's a flower a type of freesia but what it means to us is that if two people picture the same image at the same time that is the secret you can be together but projecting two different images and either whoever's the stronger at the time will get his or her fantasy fulfilled or you will get nothing but mishmash  oh yeah that is like when we did the bed-in in toronto in  they all came charging through the door thinking we were going to be screwing in bed of course we were just sitting there with peace signs  our life is our art that's what the bed-ins were when we got married we knew our honeymoon was going to be public anyway so we decided to use it to make a statement we sat in bed and talked to reporters for seven days it was hilarious in effect we were doing a commercial for peace on the front page of the papers instead of a commercial for war  yes we answered questions one guy kept going over the point about hitler 'what do you do about fascists how can you have peace when you've got a hitler' yoko said 'i would have gone to bed with him' she said she'd have needed only ten days with him people loved that one  very briefly it's about very ordinary things between two people the lyrics are direct simple and straight i went through my dylanesque period a long time ago with songs like 'i am the walrus' the trick of never saying what you mean but giving the impression of something more where more or less can be read into it it's a good game  well i like all music depending on what time of day it is i don't like styles of music or people per se i can't say i enjoy the pretenders but i like their hit record i enjoy the b-s because i heard them doing yoko it's great if yoko ever goes back to her old sound they'll be saying 'yeah she's copying the b-s'  i love all this punky stuff it's pure i'm not however crazy about the people who destroy themselves  i hate it it's better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out i don't appreciate worship of dead sid vicious or of dead james dean or of dead john wayne it's the same thing making sid vicious a hero jim morrison it's garbage to me i worship the people who survive gloria swanson greta garbo they're saying john wayne conquered cancer he whipped it like a man you know i'm sorry that he died and all that i'm sorry for his family but he didn't whip cancer it whipped him i don't want sean worshiping john wayne or sid vicious what do they teach you nothing death sid vicious died for what so that we might rock i mean it's garbage you know if neil young admires that sentiment so much why doesn't he do it because he sure as hell faded away and came back many times like all of us no thank you i'll take the living and the healthy  muzak or classical i don't purchase records i do enjoy listening to things like japanese folk music or indian music my tastes are very broad when i was a housewife i just had muzak on background music 'cuz it relaxes you  least of all my own  are you kidding for pleasure i would never listen to them when i hear them i just think of the session it's like an actor watching himself in an old movie when i hear a song i remember the abbey road studio the session who fought with whom where i was sitting banging the tambourine in the corner  no i'm not interested i'm not a fan you see i might like jerry lee lewis singing 'a whole lot a shakin' on the record but i'm not interested in seeing him perform it  i'm always proud and pleased when people do my songs it gives me pleasure that they even attempt them because a lot of my songs aren't that doable i go to restaurants and the groups always play 'yesterday' i even signed a guy's violin in spain after he played us 'yesterday' he couldn't understand that i didn't write the song but i guess he couldn't have gone from table to table playing 'i am the walrus'  it wasn't really me or us it was the times it happened to me when i heard rock 'n roll in the fifties i had no idea about doing music as a way of life until rock 'n' roll hit me  it was 'rock around the clock' i think i enjoyed bill haley but i wasn't overwhelmed by him it wasn't until 'heartbreak hotel' that i really got into it  but what moved the beatles  alright whatever wind was blowing at the time moved the beatles too i'm not saying we weren't flags on the top of a ship; but the whole boat was moving maybe the beatles were in the crow's-nest shouting 'land ho' or something like that but we were all in the same damn boat  this beatles talk bores me to death turn to page   we tuned in to the message that's all i don't mean to belittle the beatles when i say they weren't this they weren't that i'm just trying not to overblow their importance as separate from society and i don't think they were more important than glenn miller or woody herman or bessie smith it was our generation that's all it was sixties music  all music is rehash there are only a few notes just variations on a theme try to tell the kids in the seventies who were screaming to the bee gees that their music was just the beatles redone there is nothing wrong with the bee gees they do a damn good job there was nothing else going on then  the beatles were more intellectual so they appealed on that level too but the basic appeal of the beatles was not their intelligence it was their music it was only after some guy in the 'london times' said there were aeolian cadences in 'it won't be long' that the middle classes started listening to it because somebody put a tag on it  to this day i don't have any idea what they are they sound like exotic birds  for instance  i said 'cranberry sauce' that's all i said some people like ping-pong other people like digging over graves some people will do anything rather than be here now  no no no i had this whole choir saying 'everybody's got one everybody's got one' but when you get people male and female on top of cellos and on top of the beatles' rock 'n roll rhythm section you can't hear what they're saying  anything you name it one penis one vagina one asshole-- you name it  no it has nothing to do with me it's like that guy son of sam who was having these talks with the dog manson was just an extreme version of the people who came up with the 'paul is dead' thing or who figured out that the initials to 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' were lsd and concluded i was writing about acid  my son julian came in one day with a picture he painted about a school friend of his named lucy he had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' simple  the images were from 'alice in wonderland' it was alice in the boat she is buying an egg and it turns into humpty dumpty the woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and i was visualizing that there was also the image of the female who would someday come save me a 'girl with kaleidoscope eyes' who would come out of the sky it turned out to be yoko though i hadn't met yoko yet so maybe it should be 'yoko in the sky with diamonds'  it's all equally irrelevant mine is to do and other people's is to record i suppose does it matter how many drugs were in elvis' body i mean brian epstein's sex life will make a nice 'hollywood babylon' someday but it is irrelevant  i went on holiday to spain with brian which started all the rumors that he and i were having a love affair well it was almost a love affair but not quite it was never consummated but we did have a pretty intense relationship and it was my first experience with someone i knew was a homosexual he admitted it to me we had this holiday together because cyn was pregnant and we left her with the baby and went to spain lots of funny stories you know we used to sit in cafs and brian would look at all the boys and i would ask 'do you like that one do you like this one' it was just the combination of our closeness and the trip that started the rumors  right  it was the first song i wrote that was consciously about my life 'there are places i'll remember/ all my life though some have changed' before we were just writing songs a la everly brothers buddy holly-- pop songs with no more thought to them than that the words were almost irrelevant 'in my life' started out as a bus journey from my house at menlove avenue to town mentioning all the places i could recall i wrote it all down and it was boring so i forgot about it and laid back and these lyrics started coming to me about friends and lovers of the past paul helped with the middle-eight  well we all know about 'yesterday' i have had so much accolade for 'yesterday' that is paul's song of course and paul's baby well done beautiful-- and i never wished i had written it  this is paul with a little help from me 'what do you see when you turn out the light/ i can't tell you but i know it's mine' is mine  the first line was written on one acid trip one weekend the second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend and it was filled in after i met yoko part of it was putting down hare krishna all these people were going on about hare krishna allen ginsberg in particular the reference to 'element'ry penguin' is the elementary naive attitude of going around chanting 'hare krishna' or putting all your faith in any one idol i was writing obscurely a la dylan in those days  it actually was fantastic in stereo but you never hear it all there was too much to get on it was too messy a mix one track was live bbc radio-- shakespeare or something-- i just fed in whatever lines came in  it's from 'the walrus and the carpenter' 'alice in wonderland' to me it was a beautiful poem it never dawned on me that lewis carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system i never went into that bit about what he really meant like people are doing with the beatles' work later i went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy i thought oh shit i picked the wrong guy i should have said 'i am the carpenter' but that wouldn't have been the same would it 'i am the carpenter'  that was written by paul when we were in new york forming apple and he first met linda maybe she's the one who came in the window she must have i don't know somebody came in the window  that's me including the guitar lick with the first feedback ever recorded i defy anybody to find an earlier record unless it is some old blues record from the twenties with feedback on it  paul completely i would never even dream of writing a song like that there are some areas i never think about and that is one of them  just as it sounds i was reading the paper one day and i noticed two stories one was the guinness heir who killed himself in a car that was the main headline story he died in london in a car crash on the next page was a story about holes in blackburn lancashire in the streets that is they were going to fill them all paul's contribution was the beautiful little lick in the song 'i'd love to turn you on' i had the bulk of the song and the words but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldn't use for anything i thought it was a damn good piece of work  reminisce away  paul and i finished that one off for the stones we were taken down by brian to meet them at the club where they were playing in richmond they wanted a song and we went to see what kind of stuff they did paul had this bit of a song and we played it roughly for them and they said 'yeah ok that's our style' but it was only really a lick so paul and i went off in the corner of the room and finished the song off while they were all sitting there talking we came back and mick and keith said 'jesus look at that they just went over there and wrote it' you know right in front of their eyes we gave it to them it was a throwaway ringo sang it for us and the stones did their version it shows how much importance we put on them we weren't going to give them anything great right that was the stones' first record anyway mick and keith said 'if they can write a song so easily we should try it' they say it inspired them to start writing together  strawberry fields is a real place after i stopped living at penny lane i moved in with my auntie who lived in the suburbs in a nice semidetached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all the beatles stories in the class system it was about half a class higher than paul george and ringo who lived in government-subsidized housing we owned our house and had a garden they didn't have anything like that near that home was strawberry fields a house near a boys' reformatory where i used to go to garden parties as a kid with my friends nigel and pete we would go there and hang out and sell lemonade bottles for a penny we always had fun at strawberry fields so that's where i got the name but i used it as an image strawberry fields forever  'with eyes closed misunderstanding all you see' it still goes doesn't it aren't i saying exactly the same thing now the awareness apparently trying to be expressed is-- let's say in one way i was always hip i was hip in kindergarten i was different from the others i was different all my life the second verse goes 'no one i think is in my tree' well i was too shy and self-doubting nobody seems to be as hip as me is what i was saying therefore i must be crazy or a genius-- 'i mean it must be high or low' the next line there was something wrong with me i thought because i seemed to see things other people didn't see i thought i was crazy or an egomaniac for claiming to see things other people didn't see as a child i would say 'but this is going on!' and everybody would look at me as if i was crazy i always was so psychic or intuitive or poetic or whatever you want to call it that i was always seeing things in a hallucinatory way it was scary as a child because there was nobody to relate to neither my auntie nor my friends nor anybody could ever see what i did it was very very scary and the only contact i had was reading about an oscar wilde or a dylan thomas or a vincent van gogh-- all those books that my auntie had that talked about their suffering because of their visions because of what they saw they were tortured by society for trying to express what they were i saw loneliness  only dead people in books lewis carroll certain paintings surrealism had a great effect on me because then i realized that my imagery and my mind wasn't insanity; that if it was insane i belong in an exclusive club that sees the world in those terms surrealism to me is reality psychic vision to me is reality even as a child when i looked at myself in the mirror or when i was   i used to literally trance out into alpha i didn't know what it was called then i found out years later there is a name for those conditions but i would find myself seeing hallucinatory images of my face changing and becoming cosmic and complete it caused me to always be a rebel this thing gave me a chip on the shoulder; but on the other hand i wanted to be loved and accepted part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic musician but i cannot be what i am not because of my attitude all the other boys' parents including paul's father would say 'keep away from him' the parents instinctively recognized what i was which was a troublemaker meaning i did not conform and i would influence their kids which i did i did my best to disrupt every friend's home i had partly maybe it was out of envy that i didn't have this so-called home but i really did i had an auntie and an uncle and a nice suburban home thank you very much hear this auntie she was hurt by a remark paul made recently that the reason i am staying home with sean now is because i never had a family life it's absolute rubbish there were five women who were my family five strong intelligent women five sisters one happened to be my mother my mother was the youngest she just couldn't deal with life she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me and when i was four and a half i ended up living with her elder sister now those women were fantastic one day i might do a kind of 'forsyte saga' just about them that was my first feminist education anyway that knowledge and the fact that i wasn't with my parents made me see that parents are not gods i would infiltrate the other boys' minds paul's parents were terrified of me and my influence simply because i was free from the parents' strangle hold that was the gift i got for not having parents i cried a lot about not having them and it was torture but it also gave me an awareness early i wasn't an orphan though my mother was alive and lived a -minute walk away from me all my life i saw her off and on i just didn't live with her  no she got killed by an off-duty cop who was drunk after visiting my auntie's house where i lived i wasn't there at the time she was just at a bus stop i was  that was another big trauma for me i lost her twice when i was five and i moved in with my auntie and then when she physically died that made me more bitter; the chip on my shoulder i had as a youth got really big then i was just really re-establishing the relationship with her and she was killed  the song is for her and for yoko  i never saw him again until i made a lot of money and he came back   or  i opened the 'daily express' and there he was washing dishes in a small hotel or something very near where i was living in the stockbroker belt outside london he had been writing to me to try to get in contact i didn't want to see him i was too upset about what he'd done to me and to my mother and that he would turn up when i was rich and famous and not bother turning up before so i wasn't going to see him at all but he sort of blackmailed me in the press by saying all this about being a poor man washing dishes while i was living in luxury i fell for it and saw him and we had some kind of relationship he died a few years later of cancer but at  he married a secretary who had been working for the beatles age  and they had a child which i thought was hopeful for a man who had lived his life as a drunk and almost a bowery bum  when 'help' came out in ' i was actually crying out for help most people think it's just a fast rock 'n roll song i didn't realize it at the time; i just wrote the song because i was commissioned to write it for the movie but later i knew i really was crying out for help it was my fat elvis period you see the movie he -- i -- is very fat very insecure and he's completely lost himself and i am singing about when i was so much younger and all the rest looking back at how easy it was now i may be very positive yes yes but i also go through deep depressions where i would like to jump out the window you know it becomes easier to deal with as i get older; i don't know whether you learn control or when you grow up you calm down a little anyway i was fat and depressed and i was crying out for help in those days when the beatles were depressed we had this little chant i would yell out 'where are we going fellows' they would say 'to the top johnny' in pseudo-american voices and i would say 'where is that fellows' and they would say 'to the toppermost of the poppermost' it was some dumb expression from a cheap movie a la 'blackboard jungle' about liverpool johnny was the leader of the gang  the beatles thing had just gone beyond comprehension we were smoking marijuana for breakfast we were well into marijuana and nobody could communicate with us because we were just all glazed eyes giggling all the time in our own world that was the song 'help' i think everything that comes out of a song-- even paul's songs now which are apparently about nothing-- shows something about yourself  part of me suspects that i'm a loser and the other part of me thinks i'm god almighty  the song is self-explanatory the song got banned even though it's antidrug they're so stupid about drugs you know they're not looking at the cause of the drug problem why do people take drugs to escape from what is life so terrible are we living in such a terrible situation that we can't do anything without reinforcement of alcohol tobacco aspirins sleeping pills uppers downers never mind the heroin and cocaine-- they're just the outer fringes of librium and speed  not really if somebody gives me a joint i might smoke it but i don't go after it  i've had cocaine but i don't like it the beatles had lots of it in their day but it's a dumb drug because you have to have another one minutes later your whole concentration goes on getting the next fix really i find caffeine is easier to deal with  not in years a little mushroom or peyote is not beyond my scope you know maybe twice a year or something you don't hear about it anymore but people are still visiting the cosmos we must always remember to thank the cia and the army for lsd that's what people forget everything is the opposite of what it is isn't it harry so get out the bottle boy and relax they invented lsd to control people and what they did was give us freedom sometimes it works in mysterious ways its wonders to perform if you look in the government reports on acid the ones who jumped out the window or killed themselves because of it i think even with art linkletter's daughter it happened to her years later so let's face it she wasn't really on acid when she jumped out the window and i've never met anybody who's had a flashback on acid i've never had a flashback in my life and i took millions of trips in the sixties  we're mostly macrobiotic but sometimes i take the family out for a pizza  macrobiotic people don't believe in the big c whether you take that as a rationalization or not macrobiotics don't believe that smoking is bad for you of course if we die we're wrong  he said it was written about julian he knew i was splitting with cyn and leaving julian then he was driving to see julian to say hello he had been like an uncle and he came up with 'hey jude' but i always heard it as a song to me now i'm sounding like one of those fans reading things into it think about it yoko had just come into the picture he is saying 'hey jude'-- 'hey john' subconsciously he was saying 'go ahead leave me' on a conscious level he didn't want me to go ahead the angel in him was saying 'bless you' the devil in him didn't like it at all because he didn't want to lose his partner  i was lying on the sofa in our house listening to yoko play beethoven's 'moonlight sonata' on the piano suddenly i said 'can you play those chords backward' she did and i wrote 'because' around them the song sounds like 'moonlight sonata' too the lyrics are clear no bullshit no imagery no obscure references  all we were saying was give peace a chance  no i don't even know why his name was on it it's there because i kind of felt guilty because i'd made the separate single-- the first-- and i was really breaking away from the beatles  paul and i made a deal when we were  there was never a legal deal between us just a deal we made when we decided to write together that we put both our names on it no matter what  the idea came from this thing my mother used to sing to me when i was one or two years old when she was still living with me it was from a disney movie 'do you want to know a secret promise not to tell you are standing by a wishing well' so with that in my head i wrote the song and just gave it to george to sing i thought it would be a good vehicle for him because it had only three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the world he has improved a lot since then; but in those days his ability was very poor i gave it to him just to give him a piece of the action that's another reason why i was hurt by his book i even went to the trouble of making sure he got the b side of a beatles single because he hadn't had a b side of one until 'do you want to know a secret' 'something' was the first time he ever got an a side because paul and i always wrote both sides that wasn't because we were keeping him out but simply because his material was not up to scratch i made sure he got the b side of 'something' too so he got the cash those little things he doesn't remember i always felt bad that george and ringo didn't get a piece of the publishing when the opportunity came to give them five percent each of maclen it was because of me they got it it was not because of klein and not because of paul but because of me when i said they should get it paul couldn't say no i don't get a piece of any of george's songs or ringo's i never asked for anything for the contributions i made to george's songs like 'taxman' not even the recognition and that is why i might have sounded resentful about george and ringo because it was after all those things that the attitude of 'john has forsaken us' and 'john is tricking us' came out which is not true  no it's not about heroin a gun magazine was sitting there with a smoking gun on the cover and an article that i never read inside called 'happiness is a warm gun' i took it right from there i took it as the terrible idea of just having shot some animal  well it was at the beginning of my relationship with yoko and i was very sexually oriented then when we weren't in the studio we were in bed  i call yoko mother or madam just in an offhand way the rest doesn't mean anything it's just images of her  the beatles didn't make a good record of 'across the universe' i think subconsciously we i thought paul subconsciously tried to destroy my great songs we would play experimental games with my great pieces like 'strawberry fields' which i always felt was badly recorded it worked but it wasn't what it could have been i allowed it though we would spend hours doing little detailed cleaning up on paul's songs but when it came to mine especially a great song like 'strawberry fields' or 'across the universe' somehow an atmosphere of looseness and experimentation would come up  subconscious sabotage i was too hurt paul will deny it because he has a bland face and will say this doesn't exist this is the kind of thing i'm talking about where i was always seeing what was going on and began to think well maybe i'm paranoid but it is not paranoid it is the absolute truth the same thing happened to 'across the universe' the song was never done properly the words stand luckily  it is a diary form of writing all that 'i used to be cruel to my woman i beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved' was me i used to be cruel to my woman and physically any woman i was a hitter i couldn't express myself and i hit i fought men and i hit women that is why i am always on about peace you see it is the most violent people who go for love and peace everything's the opposite but i sincerely believe in love and peace i am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence i will have to be a lot older before i can face in public how i treated women as a youngster  we recorded the song twice the beatles were getting really tense with one another i did the slow version and i wanted it out as a single as a statement of the beatles' position on vietnam and the beatles' position on revolution for years on the beatle tours epstein had stopped us from saying anything about vietnam or the war and he wouldn't allow questions about it but on one tour i said 'i am going to answer about the war we can't ignore it' i absolutely wanted the beatles to say something the first take of 'revolution' well george and paul were resentful and said it wasn't fast enough now if you go into details of what a hit record is and isn't maybe but the beatles could have afforded to put out the slow understandable version of 'revolution' as a single whether it was a gold record or a wooden record but because they were so upset about the yoko period and the fact that i was again becoming as creative and dominating as i had been in the early days after lying fallow for a couple of years it upset the apple cart i was awake again and they couldn't stand it  she inspired all this creation in me it wasn't that she inspired the songs; she inspired me the statement in 'revolution' was mine the lyrics stand today it's still my feeling about politics i want to see the plan that is what i used to say to abbie hoffman and jerry rubin count me out if it is for violence don't expect me to be on the barricades unless it is with flowers  well he got what he wanted which is to be sort of an underground hero for anybody who still worships any manifestation of the underground i don't feel that much about it anymore nixon hoffman it's the same they are all from the same period it was kind of surprising to see abbie on tv but it was also surprising to see nixon on tv maybe people get the feeling when they see me or us i feel what are they doing there is this an old newsreel  it's not a new message 'give peace a chance'-- we're not being unreasonable just saying 'give it a chance' with 'imagine' we're saying 'can you imagine a world without countries or religions' it's the same message over and over and it's positive  it's very sad anyway we're not saying anything new a) we have already said it and b)  other people have said it too  all we are saying is 'this is what is happening to us' we are sending postcards i don't let it become 'i am the awakened; you are sheep that will be shown the way' that is the danger of saying anything you know  listen there's nothing wrong with following examples we can have figure heads and people we admire but we don't need leaders 'don't follow leaders watch the parking meters'  i don't like to comment on it for whatever reason he's doing it it is personal for him and he needs to do it but the whole religion business suffers from the 'onward christian soldiers' bit there's too much talk about soldiers and marching and converting i'm not pushing buddhism because i'm no more a buddhist than i am a christian but there's one thing i admire about the religion there's no proselytizing  no i stopped listening to dylan with both ears after 'highway ' [sic] and 'blonde on blonde' and even then it was because george would sit me down and make me listen  had dear i had a father complex  she fought with janov all the time he couldn't deal with it  and i was the lucky cripple she chose!  alot of us are looking for fathers mine was physically not there most people's are not there mentally and physically like always at the office or busy with other things so all these leaders parking meters are all substitute fathers whether they be religious or political all this bit about electing a president we pick our own daddy out of a dog pound of daddies this is the daddy that looks like the daddy in the commercials he's got the nice gray hair and the right teeth and the parting's on the right side ok this is the daddy we choose the dog pound of daddies which is the political arena gives us a president then we put him on a platform and start punishing him and screaming at him because daddy can't do miracles daddy doesn't heal us  maharishi was a father figure elvis presley might have been a father figure i don't know robert mitchum any male image is a father figure there's nothing wrong with it until you give them the right to give you sort of a recipe for your life what happens is somebody comes along with a good piece of truth instead of the truth's being looked at the person who brought it is looked at the messenger is worshiped instead of the message so there would be christianity mohammedanism buddhism confucianism marxism maoism-- everything-- it is always about a person and never about what he says  well you went to est  we went to janov for the same reason  yeah but i wouldn't go and sit in a room and not pee  oh but i had you with me  but nobody's perfect etc etc whether it's janov or erhardt or maharishi or a beatle that doesn't take away from their message it's like learning how to swim the swimming is fine but forget about the teacher if the beatles had a message it was that with the beatles the records are the point not the beatles as individuals you don't need the package just as you don't need the christian package or the marxist package to get the message people always got the image i was an anti-christ or antireligion i'm not i'm a most religious fellow i was brought up a christian and i only now understand some of the things that christ was saying in those parables because people got hooked on the teacher and missed the message  if the beatles or the sixties had a message it was to learn to swim period and once you learn to swim swim the people who are hung up on the beatles' and the sixties' dream missed the whole point when the beatles' and the sixties' dream became the point carrying the beatles' or the sixties' dream around all your life is like carrying the second world war and glenn miller around that's not to say you can't enjoy glenn miller or the beatles but to live in that dream is the twilight zone it's not living now it's an illusion  well you make your own dream that's the beatles' story isn't it that's yoko's story that's what i'm saying now produce your own dream if you want to save peru go save peru it's quite possible to do anything but not to put it on the leaders and the parking meters don't expect jimmy carter or ronald reagan or john lennon or yoko ono or bob dylan or jesus christ to come and do it for you you have to do it yourself that's what the great masters and mistresses have been saying ever since time began they can point the way leave signposts and little instructions in various books that are now called holy and worshiped for the cover of the book and not for what it says but the instructions are all there for all to see have always been and always will be there's nothing new under the sun all the roads lead to rome and people cannot provide it for you i can't wake you up you can wake you up i can't cure you you can cure you  it's fear of the unknown the unknown is what it is and to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams illusions wars peace love hate all that it's all illusion unknown is what what it is accept that it's unknown and it's plain sailing everything is unknown then you're ahead of the game that's what it is right
