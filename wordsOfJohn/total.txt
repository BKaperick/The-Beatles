 i think it’s the best thing i’ve ever done i think it’s realistic and it’s true to the me that has been developing over the years from my life i’m a loser help strawberry fields they are all personal records i always wrote about me when i could i didn’t really enjoy writing third person songs about people who lived in concrete flats and things like that i like first person music but because of my hang-ups and many other things; i would only now and then specifically write about me now i wrote all about me and that’s why i like it it’s me! and nobody else that’s why i like it it’s real that’s all  because there was none in my head there were no hallucinations in my head  actually that’s paul’s line i was consciously writing poetry and that’s self-conscious poetry but the poetry on this album is superior to anything i’ve done because it’s not self-conscious in that way i had the least trouble writing the songs of all time  there’s no bullshit  well i’ve always liked simple rock there’s a great one in england now i hear you knocking i liked the spirit in the sky a few months back i always liked simple rock and nothing else i was influenced by acid and got psychedelic like the whole generation but really i like rock and roll and i express myself best in rock i had a few ideas to do this with mother and that with mother but when you just hear the piano does it all for you your mind can do the rest i think the backings on mine are as complicated as the backings on any record you’ve ever heard if you’ve got an ear  what’s litany  well like a lot of the words it just came out of me mouth god was put together from three songs almost i had the idea that god is the concept by which we measure pain so that when you have a word like that you just sit down and sing the first tune that comes into your head and the tune is simple because i like that kind of music and then i just rolled into it it was just going on in my head and i got by the first three or four the rest just came out whatever came out  i don’t know when i realized that i was putting down all these things i didn’t believe in so i could have gone on it was like a christmas card list where do i end churchill hoover i thought i had to stop  yes i was going to leave a gap and just fill in your own words whoever you don’t believe in it had just got out of hand and beatles was the final thing because i no longer believe in myth and beatles is another myth  i didn’t know that i don’t know i’ll be able to tell in a week or so what’s going on because they [the radio] started off playing look at me because it was easy and they probably thought it was the beatles or something so i don’t know if that is the one well that’s the one; god and working class hero probably are the best whatevers–sort of ideas or feelings–on the record  because dylan is bullshit zimmerman is his name you see i don’t believe in dylan and i don’t believe in tom jones either in that way zimmerman is his name my name isn’t john beatle it’s john lennon just like that  because that’s what’s happened all these songs just came out of me i didn’t sit down to think i’m going to write about mother or i didn’t sit down to think i’m going to write about this that or the other they all came out like all the best work that anybody ever does whether it is an article or what it’s just the best ones that come out and all these came out because i had time if you are on holiday or in therapy wherever you are if you do spend time like in india i wrote the last batch of best songs like i’m so tired and yer blues they’re pretty realistic they were about me they always struck me as–what is the word funny ironic–that i was writing them supposedly in the presence of guru and meditating so many hours a day writing i’m so tired and songs of such pain as yer blues which i meant i was right in the maharishi’s camp writing i wanna die  well a bit i’m a bit self-conscious–we all were a bit self-conscious and the beatles were super self-conscious people about parody of americans which we do and have done  yes there was a self-consciousness about singing blues we were all listening to sleepy john estes and all that in art school like everybody else but to sing it was something else i’m self conscious about doing it  nobody knows there is a point on the first song on yoko’s track where the guitar comes in and even yoko thought it was her voice because we did all yoko’s in one night the whole session except for the track with ornette coleman from the past that we put on to show people that she wasn’t discovered by the beatles and that she’s been around a few years we got stuff of her with cage ornette coleman we are going to put out oldies but goldies next for yoko i’ll play it again and talk about it later  why  no no listen to cold turkey  listen to twist and shout i couldn’t sing the damn thing i was just screaming listen to it wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-wop-bam-boom don’t get the therapy confused with the music yoko’s whole thing was that scream don’t worry kyoko was one of the fuckin’ best rock and roll records ever made listen to it and play tutti fruitti listen to don’t worry kyoko on the other side of cold turkey  so is this you know i announced cold turkey at the lyceum saying i’m going to sing a song about pain so pain and screaming was before janov i mean janov showed me more of my own pain i went through therapy with him like i told you and i’m probably looser all over  no janov showed me how to feel my own fear and pain therefore i can handle it better than i could before that’s all i’m the same only there’s a channel it doesn’t just remain in me it goes round and out i can move a little easier  it just was not too much fun i never injected it or anything we sniffed a little when we were in real pain we got such a hard time from everyone and i’ve had so much thrown at me and at yoko especially at yoko like peter brown in our office–and you can put this in–after we come in after six months he comes down and shakes my hand and doesn’t even say hello to her that’s going on all the time and we get into so much pain that we have to do something about it and that’s what happened to us we took h because of what the beatles and others were doing to us but we got out of it  but let’s not take away from what he did do which expended a lot of energy and taught me a lot and i would use him again  well i learned a lot on this album technically i didn’t have to learn so much before usually paul and i would be listening to it and we wouldn’t have to listen to each individual sound so there are a few things i learned this time about bass one track or another where you can get more in and where i lost something on a track and some technical things that irritated me finally but as a concept and as a whole thing i’m pleased yes that’s about it really if i get down to the nitty gritty it would drive me mad but i do like it really  i like both i go for feeling most takes are right off and most times i sang it and played it at the same time i can’t stand putting the backing on first then the singing which is what we used to do in the old days but those days are dead you know  well i was watching tv as usual in california and there was this old horror movie on and the bells sounded like that to me it was probably different because those were actually bells slowed down that they used on the album they just sounded like that and i thought oh that’s how to start mother i knew mother was going to be the first track so  well actually some of it actually i wrote mother in england isolation in england and a few more i finished them off in california you will have to push me if you want more detail look at me was written around the beatles’ double album time you know i just never got it going there are a few like that lying around  when did i say that  i haven’t gone off it it is just that primal is like another mirror you know  it’s really like you know writers take themselves to singapore to get the atmosphere so wherever i am in that way it is sort of a primal album it’s like george’s is the first gita album  i think that is something people will go through at the beginning of that therapy because you are so astounded with what you find out about yourself you think well surely this is something because it happens to you and this must be the first time that it happened  i don’t think anything else would work on me but then of course i’m not through with it; it’s a process that is going on we primal almost daily you see i don’t really want to get this big primal thing going because it is so embarrassing the thing in a nutshell primal therapy allowed us to feel feelings continually and those feelings usually make you cry that’s all because before i wasn’t feeling things that’s all i was blocking the feelings and when the feelings come through you cry it’s as simple as that really  maybe  it’s probably better because i have the whole time to myself you know i mean i’m pretty good at home with the tapes this time it was my album and it used to get a bit embarrassing in front of george and paul because we know each other so well we used to be a bit supercritical of each other so we inhibited each other a lot and now i have yoko there and phil there alternatively and together who sort of love me so that i can perform better and i relaxed i’ve got a whole studio at home now and i think it will be better next time because that is even less inhibiting than going to emi it’s like that but the looseness of the singing was developing on cold turkey from the experience of yoko’s singing you see she does not inhibit her throat  yes well she plays wind she played atmosphere she has a musical ear and she can produce rock and roll she can produce me which she did for some of the tracks i’m not going to start saying that she did this and he did that but when phil couldn’t come at first you don’t have to be born and bred in rock she knows when a bass sound is right and when a guy is playing out of rhythm and when the engineer–she had a bit of trouble–the engineer thinks well who the hell is this what does she know about it so she did that for me  anybody that sings with a guitar and sings about something heavy would tend to sound like this i’m bound to be influenced by those because that is the only kind of real folk music i really listen to i never liked the fruity judy collins and baez and all of that stuff so the only folk music i know is about miners up in newcastle or dylan in that way i would be influenced but it doesn’t sound like dylan to me does it sound like dylan to you  that’s the only way to play i never listen that hard to him  no i put it in because it fit i didn’t even realize that there were two in the song until somebody pointed it out when i actually sang it i missed a verse which i had to add in later you do say fucking crazy; that is how i speak i was very near to it many times in the past but i would deliberately not put it in which is the real hypocrisy the real stupidity  in england it’s the day they blew up the houses of parliament so we celebrate by having bonfires every november th guy fawkes day it just was an ad lib it was about the third take and i got to remembering and it begins to sound like frankie laine you know when you sing remember the fifth of november i just broke up and it went on for about another seven or eight minutes we started ad libbing and goofing about but then i cut it there and just exploded it was a good joke haven’t you ever heard of guy fawkes i thought it was just poignant that we should blow up the houses of parliament  i get embarrassed you see sometimes i can hear it and be embarrassed just by the performance of either the music or the statements and sometimes i don’t i change daily you know like just before it’s coming out i can’t bear to hear it in the house or play it anywhere but a few months before that i can play it all the time it just changes all the time  i don’t know what you mean really  well pain is the pain we go through all the time you’re born in pain pain is what we are in most of the time and i think that the bigger the pain the more god you look for  i never heard of it you see it was my own revelation i don’t know who wrote about it or what anybody else said i just know that’s what i know  yes i just felt it it was like i was crucified when i felt it so i know what they’re talking about now  george martin i don’t know you see for quite a few of our albums like the beatles’ double albums george martin didn’t really produce it in the early days i can remember what george martin did  he would translate if paul wanted to use violins he would translate it for him like in my life there is an elizabethan piano solo in it so he would do things like that we would say play like bach or something so he would put bars in there he helped us develop a language to talk to musicians  well it’s not instead of george martin that’s nothing personal against george martin he’s more paul’s style of music than mine but i don’t know really it’s a drag to do both to go in the recording studio and then you run back and say did you get it  yes yes phil i believe is a great artist and like all great artists he’s very neurotic but we’ve done quite a few tracks together yoko and i and she’d be encouraging me in the other room and all that and–at one point in the middle we were just lagging–phil moved in and brought in a new life we were getting heavy because we had done a few things and the thrill of recording had worn off a little so you can hear spector here and there there is no specifics you can just hear him  yes i just threw up for hours until i went on i even threw up i read a review in stone the one about the film [toronto pop by da pennebaker] i haven’t seen yet and they were saying i was this and that i was throwing up nearly in the number i could hardly sing any of them i was full of shit  always that nervous but what with one thing and another it just had to come out some way i don’t think i’ll do much appearing it’s not worth the strain i don’t want to perform too much for people  i don’t know i think it’s all right you know personally at home i wouldn’t play that kind of music i don’t want to hurt george’s feelings i don’t know what to say about it i think it’s better than paul’s  i thought paul’s was rubbish i think he’ll make a better one when he’s frightened into it but i thought that first one was just a lot of remember what i told you when it came out light and easy you know that crack but then i listen to the radio and i hear george’s stuff coming over well then it’s pretty bloody good my personal tastes are very strange you know  sounds like wop bop a loo bop i like rock and roll man i don’t like much else  that’s the music that inspired me to play music there is nothing conceptually better than rock and roll no group be it beatles dylan or stones have ever improved on whole lot of shaking for my money or maybe i’m like our parents that’s my period and i dig it and i’ll never leave it  i don’t know what it is you would have to name it i don’t think there’s  no i never listen only when i’m recording or about to bring something out will i listen just before i record i go buy a few albums to see what people are doing whether they have improved any or whether anything happened and nothing’s really happened there’s a lot of great guitarists and musicians around but nothing’s happening you know i don’t like the blood sweat and tears shit i think all that is bullshit rock and roll is going like jazz as far as i can see and the bullshitters are going off into that excellentness which i never believed in and others going off i consider myself in the avant garde of rock and roll because i’m with yoko and she taught me a lot and i taught her a lot and i think on her album you can hear it if i can get away from her album for a moment  i thought it wasn’t much because i expect more–maybe i expect too much from people – but i expect more i haven’t been a dylan follower since he stopped rocking i liked rolling stone and a few things he did then; i like a few things he did in the early days the rest of it is just like lennon-mccartney or something it’s no different its a myth  no it might be a new morning for him because he stopped singing on the top of his voice it’s all right but it’s not him it doesn’t mean a fucking thing i’d sooner have i hear you knocking by dave edmonds it’s the top of england now  i can’t imagine what george thinks well i suppose he thinks i’ve lost the way or something like that but to me i’m like home i’ll never change much from this  they remembered that they were four individuals you see we believed the beatles myth too i don’t know whether the others still believe it we were four guys i met paul and said you want to join me band then george joined and then ringo joined we were just a band that made it very very big that’s all our best work was never recorded  because we were performers–in spite of what mick says about us–in liverpool hamburg and other dance halls what we generated was fantastic when we played straight rock and there was nobody to touch us in britain as soon as we made it we made it but the edges were knocked off  i’m a very nervous person really i’m not as big-headed as this tape sounds this is me projecting through the fear so i choose people that i know rather than strangers  because in spite of all the things the beatles could really play music together when they weren’t uptight and if i get a thing going ringo knows where to go just like that and he does well we’ve played together so long that it fits that’s the only thing i sometimes miss is just being able to sort of blink or make a certain noise and i know they’ll all know where we are going on an ad lib thing but i don’t miss it that much  well it depends on what kind of guitarist i’m ok i’m not technically good but i can make it fucking howl and move i was rhythm guitarist it’s an important job i can make a band drive  he’s pretty good i prefer myself i have to be honest you know i’m really very embarrassed about my guitar playing in one way because it’s very poor i can never move but i can make a guitar speak  listen to why on yoko’s album i found out i think it’s nice it drives along ask eric clapton he thinks i can play ask him you see a lot of you people want technical things; it’s like wanting technical films most critics of rock and roll and guitarists are in the stage of the fifties when they wanted a technically perfect film finished for them and then they would feel happy  yes i played the solo on that when paul was feeling kindly he would give me a solo! maybe if he was feeling guilty that he had most of the a side or something he would give me a solo and i played the solo on that i think george produced some beautiful guitar playing but i think he’s too hung up to really let go but so is eric really maybe he’s changed they’re all so hung up we all are that’s the problem i really like bb king  i think it’s a good record i wouldn’t buy any of it you know i think it’s a good record and i was pleasantly surprised to hear beaucoups of blues that song you know i thought good i was glad and i didn’t feel as embarrassed as i did about his first record  i felt sad you know also i felt that film was set-up by paul for paul that is one of the main reasons the beatles ended i can’t speak for george but i pretty damn well know we got fed up of being side-men for paul  after brian died we collapsed paul took over and supposedly led us but what is leading us when we went round in circles we broke up then that was the disintegration  i don’t remember you know i was in my own pain i wasn’t noticing really i just did it like a job the beatles broke up after brian died; we made the double album the set it’s like if you took each track off it and made it all mine and all george’s it’s like i told you many times it was just me and a backing group paul and a backing group and i enjoyed it we broke up then  we were in wales with the maharishi we had just gone down after seeing his lecture first night we heard it then and then we went right off into the maharishi thing  in wales a place called bangor in wales  we were just outside a lecture hall with maharishi and i don’t know i can’t remember it just sort of came over somebody came up to us the press were there because we had gone down with this strange indian and they said brian’s dead and i was stunned we went in to him what he’s dead and all were i suppose and the marharishi we went in to him what he’s dead and all that and he was sort of saying oh forget it be happy like an idiot like parents smile that’s what the maharishi said and we did  the feeling that anybody has when somebody close to them dies there is a sort of little hysterical sort of hee hee i’m glad it’s not me or something in it the funny feeling when somebody close to you dies i don’t know whether you’ve had it but i’ve had a lot of people die around me and the other feeling is what the fuck what can i do  well we went with maharishi i remember being in wales and then i can’t remember though i will probably have to have a bloody primal to remember this i don’t remember it just all happened  i don’t know how the others took it it’s no good asking me it’s like asking me how you took it i don’t know i’m in me own head i can’t be in anybody else’s i don’t know really what george paul or ringo think anymore i know them pretty well but i don’t know anybody that well yoko i know about the best i don’t know how they felt it was my own thing we were all just dazed  that’s right i don’t know how much of this i want to put out paul had an impression he has it now like a parent that we should be thankful for what he did for keeping the beatles going but when you look back upon it objectively he kept it going for his own sake was it for my sake paul struggled  that ended i don’t know around  or something i don’t know if you give me the albums i can tell you exactly who wrote what and which line we sometimes wrote together all our best work–apart from the early days like i want to hold your hand we wrote together and things like that–we wrote apart always the one after  on the let it be lp i wrote when i was or  we always wrote separately but we wrote together because we enjoyed it a lot sometimes and also because they would say well you’re going to make an album get together and knock off a few songs just like a job  i don’t know i don’t know probably george’s i have no idea yoko and i met around then i lost me nerve because i was going to take me ex-wife and yoko but i don’t know how to work it so i didn’t quite do it  that’s about the maharishi yes i copped out and i wouldn’t write maharishi what have you done you made a fool of everyone but now it can be told fab listeners  i don’t know i just sort of saw him  yes there was a big hullaballo about him trying to rape mia farrow or somebody and trying to get off with a few other women and things like that we went to see him after we stayed up all night discussing was it true or not true when george started thinking it might be true i thought well it must be true; because if george started thinking it might be true there must be something in it  i always do i always expect too much i was always expecting my mother and never got her that’s what it is you know or some parent i know that much  the apple thing that was to announce apple  i don’t remember that you know we all say a lot of things when we don’t know what we’re talking about i’m probably doing it now i don’t know what i say you see everybody takes you up on the words you said and i’m just a guy that people ask all about things and i blab off and some of it makes sense and some of it is bullshit and some of it’s lies and some of it is–god knows what i’m saying i don’t know what i said about maharishi all i know is what we said about apple which was worse  all right  clive epstein or some other such business freak came up to us and said you’ve got to spend so much money or the tax will take you we were thinking of opening a chain of retail clothes shops or some balmy thing like that and we were all thinking that if we are going to have to open a shop let’s open something we’re interested in and we went through all these different ideas about this that and the other paul had a nice idea about opening up white houses where we would sell white china and things like that everything white because you can never get anything white you know which was pretty groovy and it didn’t end up with that it ended up with apple and all this junk and the fool and all those stupid clothes and all that  i don’t know he’s still in london  i think some of his stuff actually has come true but they just haven’t been manufactured–maybe one of them is a salable object he was just another guy who comes and goes around people like us he’s all right but he’s cracked you know  i don’t know i was controlling the scene at the time i mean i was the one going in the office and shouting about paul had done it for six months and then i walked in and changed everything there were all the peter browns reporting behind my back to paul saying you know john’s doing this and john’s doing that that john he’s crazy i was always the one that must be crazy because i wouldn’t let them have status quo  no we read it in the papers that was when we started events i learned events from yoko we made everything into events from then on and got rid of it  i’d been planning on it for over a year and a bit i was waiting for a time to do it  that’s the truth  i don’t know what it was  yes i do well we always had we always kept them on their toes during our events period i don’t know but we said we had some other surprise for them later i can’t remember what it was  i didn’t really want to talk about all this go on  well we’re halfway through it now so let’s do it  yes  i said to paul i’m leaving  no i wasn’t angry  no i wasn’t angry–shit he’s a good pr man that’s all he’s about the best in the world probably he really does a job i wasn’t angry we were all hurt that he didn’t tell us that was what he was going to do  i was cursing because i hadn’t done it i wanted to do it i should have done it ah damn shit what a fool i was but there were many pressures at that time with the northern songs fight going on; it would have upset the whole thing if i would have said that  sure i did he’s another one of those people who think they made us they didn’t i’d like to hear dick james’ music and i’d like to hear george martin’s music please just play me some dick james actually has said that  that he made us people are under a delusion that they made us when in fact we made them  he didn’t tell us he did it it was just a fait accompli he went and sold his thing to lew grade that’s all we knew we read it in the paper i think  oh it was fantastic it was like this room full of old men smoking and fighting it’s great people seem to think that businessmen like allen or grade or any of them are a race apart they play the game the way we play music and it’s something to see they play a game first they have a ritual then they create allen he’s a very creative guy you know he creates situations which create positions for them to move in they all do it you know and it’s a sight to see we played our part we both did  with the bankers and things like that i think allen could tell you better because i don’t know everything seems as though it’s going to be trouble like you can’t say anything about anybody because you’re going to get sued or something like that allen will tell you what we did  how do you describe the job you know you know my job–i maneuver people that’s what leaders do and i sit and make situations which will be of benefit to me with other people it’s as simple as that i had to do a job to get allen in apple i did a job so did yoko  oh god yoko don’t say that maneuvering is what it is let’s not be coy about it it is a deliberate and thought-out maneuver of how to get a situation the way we want it that’s how life’s about isn’t it is it not  instinctive doesn’t isn’t dick james–so is lew grade–they’re all instinctive so is he if it’s instinctive–but it’s maneuvering there’s nothing ashamed about it we all do it it’s just owning up you know not going around saying god bless you brother pretending there is no vested interest  that’s not the thing the point i’m talking about is creating a situation around apple and the beatles in which allen could come in that is what i’m talking about and he wouldn’t have gotten in unless i’d done it and he wouldn’t have gotten in unless you’d done it you made the decision too  the same as i get anything i want the same as you get what you want i’m not telling you; just work at it get on the phone a little word here and a little word there and do it  you see a lot of people like the dick james derek taylors and peter browns all of them they think they’re the beatles and neil and all of them well i say fuck ‘em you know and after working with genius for ten years they begin to think they’re it they’re not  yes if there is such a thing as one i am one  when i was about  i used to think i must be a genius but nobody’s noticed i used to wonder whether i’m a genius or i’m not which is it i used to think well i can’t be mad because nobody’s put me away therefore i’m a genius a genius is a form of madness and we’re all that way you know and i used to be a bit coy about it like my guitar playing  i didn’t mention mal i said neil peter brown and derek they live in a dream of beatle past and everything they do is oriented to that they also have a warped view of what was happening i suppose we all do  well they have to grow up then they’ve only had half their life and they’ve got another whole half to go; and they can’t go on pretending to be beatles that’s where it’s at i mean when they read this they’ll think it’s cracked john if it’s in the article but that’s where it’s at they live in the past  they despised her  yes they insulted her and they still do they don’t even know i can see it and even when it’s written down it will look like i’m just paranoiac or she’s paranoiac i know just by the way the publicity on us was handled in apple all of the two years we were together and the attitude of people to us and the bits we hear from office girls we know so they can go stuff themselves  we were in our own dream but they’re the kind of idiots that really think that yoko split the beatles or allen it’s the same joke really they are that insane about allen too  yeah well if there is a god we’re all it  there is a guy in england william mann who was the first intellectual who reviewed the beatles in the times and got people talking about us in that intellectual way he wrote about aeolian cadences and all sorts of musical terms and he is a bullshitter but he made us credible with intellectuals he wrote about paul’s last album as if it were written by beethoven or something he’s still writing the same shit but it did us a lot of good in that way because people in all the middle classes and intellectuals were all going oooh  it’s the same you can quote paul it’s probably in the papers he said it many times at first he hated yoko and then he got to like her but it’s too late for me i’m for yoko why should she take that kind of shit from those people they were writing about her looking miserable in the let it be film but you sit through sessions with the most bigheaded up-tight people on earth and see what its fuckin’ like and be insulted– just because you love someone – and george shit insulted her right to her face in the apple office at the beginning just being ‘straight-forward’ you know that game of ‘i’m going to be up front’ because this is what we’ve heard and dylan and a few people said she’d got a lousy name in new york and you give off bad vibes that’s what george said to her! and we both sat through it i didn’t hit him i don’t know why  about what to do and all of that like you tell us guru probably after acid maybe after rubber soul i can’t remember it exactly happening we just took that position i mean we started putting out messages like the word is love and things like that i write messages you know see when you start putting out messages people start asking you what’s the message  a dentist in london laid it on george me and wives without telling us at a dinner party at his house he was a friend of george’s and our dentist at the time and he just put it in our coffee or something he didn’t know what it was; it’s all the same thing with that sort of middle class london swinger or whatever they had all heard about it and they didn’t know it was different from pot or pills and they gave us it he said i advise you not to leave and we all thought he was trying to keep us for an orgy in his house and we didn’t want to know and we went to the ad lib and these discotheques and there were these incredible things going on  i was pretty stoned for a month or two the second time we had it was in la we were on tour in one of those houses doris day’s house or wherever it was we used to stay and the three of us took it ringo george and i maybe neil and a couple of the byrds–what’s his name the one in the stills and nash thing crosby and the other guy who used to do the lead mcguinn i think they came i’m not sure on a few trips but there was a reporter don short we were in the garden it was only our second one and we still didn’t know anything about doing it in a nice place and cool it then they saw the reporter and thought how do we act we were terrified waiting for him to go and he wondered why we couldn’t come over neil who never had acid either had taken it and he would have to play road manager and we said go get rid of don short and he didn’t know what to do  it went on for years i must of had a thousand trips  a thousand i used to just eat it all the time i never took it in the studio once i thought i was taking some uppers and i was not in the state of handling it i can’t remember what album it was but i took it and i just noticed i suddenly got so scared on the mike i thought i felt ill and i thought i was going to crack i said i must get some air they all took me upstairs on the roof and george martin was looking at me funny and then it dawned on me i must have taken acid i said well i can’t go on you’ll have to do it and i’ll just stay and watch you know i got very nervous just watching them all i was saying is it all right and they were saying yeah they had all been very kind and they carried on making the record  george did in la the second time we took it paul felt very out of it because we are all a bit slightly cruel sort of we’re taking it and you’re not but we kept seeing him you know we couldn’t eat our food i just couldn’t manage it just picking it up with our hands there were all these people serving us in the house and we were knocking food on the floor and all of that it was a long time before paul took it then there was the big announcement  so i think george was pretty heavy on it; we are probably the most cracked paul is a bit more stable than george and i  i don’t know about straight stable i think lsd profoundly shocked him and ringo i think maybe they regret it  i had many jesus christ i stopped taking it because of that i just couldn’t stand it  it got like that but then i stopped it for i don’t know how long and then i started taking it again just before i met yoko derek came over and you see i got the message that i should destroy my ego and i did you know i was reading that stupid book of leary’s; we were going through a whole game that everybody went through and i destroyed myself i was slowly putting myself together round about maharishi time bit by bit over a two-year period i had destroyed me ego  a hard day’s night i was on pills that’s drugs that’s bigger drugs than pot started on pills when i was  no since i was  since i became a musician the only way to survive in hamburg to play eight hours a night was to take pills the waiters gave you them–the pills and drink i was a fucking dropped-down drunk in art school help was where we turned on to pot and we dropped drink simple as that i’ve always needed a drug to survive the others too but i always had more more pills more of everything because i’m more crazy probably  yes  it was only another mirror it wasn’t a miracle it was more of a visual thing and a therapy looking at yourself a bit it did all that you know i don’t quite remember but it didn’t write the music neither did janov or maharishi in the same terms i write the music in the circumstances in which i’m in whether its on acid or in the water  the story wasn’t bad but it could have been better another illusion was that we were just puppets and that these great people like brian epstein and dick lester created the situation and made this whole fuckin’ thing and precisely because we were what we were realistic we didn’t want to make a fuckin’ shitty pop movie we didn’t want to make a movie that was going to be bad and we insisted on having a real writer to write it  it was a good projection of one facade of us which was on tour once in london and once in dublin it was of us in that situation together in a hotel having to perform before people we were like that the writer saw the press conference  can you tell me whether that white album with the drawing by voorman on it was that before rubber soul or after  no maybe the others do i don’t remember those kind of things because it doesn’t mean anything it’s all gone  we were just getting better technically and musically that’s all finally we took over the studio in the early days we had to take what we were given we didn’t know how you can get more bass we were learning the technique on rubber soul we were more precise about making the album that’s all and we took over the cover and everything  that was paul’s title it was like yer blues i suppose meaning english soul i suppose just a pun there is no great mysterious meaning behind all of this it was just four boys working out what to call a new album  it was written in [london] sunday times sort of fab form and no home truths was written my auntie knocked out all the truth bits from my childhood and my mother and i allowed it which was my cop-out etcetera there was nothing about orgies and the shit that happened on tour i wanted a real book to come out but we all had wives and didn’t want to hurt their feelings end of that one because they still have wives  wherever we went there was always a whole scene going we had our four separate bedrooms we tried to keep them out of our room derek’s and neil’s rooms were always full of junk and whores and who-the-fuck-knows-what and policemen with it satyricon! we had to do something what do you do when the pill doesn’t wear off and it’s time to go i used to be up all night with derek whether there was anybody there or not i could never sleep such a heavy scene it was they didn’t call them groupies then they called it something else and if we couldn’t get groupies we would have whores and everything whatever was going  derek and neil that was their job and mal but i’m not going into all that  when we hit town we hit it there was no pissing about there’s photographs of me crawling about in amsterdam on my knees coming out of whore houses and things like that the police escorted me to the places because they never wanted a big scandal you see i don’t really want to talk about it because it will hurt yoko and it’s not fair suffice to say that they were satyricon on tour and that’s it because i don’t want to hurt their feelings or the other people’s girls either it’s just not fair  right right exactly  yes we didn’t have an affair though fuck knows what was said i was pretty close to brian if somebody is going to manage me i want to know them inside out he told me he was a fag  that i don’t know because i can’t remember it there is a better book on the beatles by michael brown love me do that was a true book he wrote how we were which was bastards you can’t be anything else in such a pressurized situation and we took it out on people like neil derek and mal that’s why underneath their facade they resent us but they can never show it and they won’t believe it when they read it they took a lot of shit from us because we were in such a shitty position it was hard work and somebody had to take it those things are left out by davies about what bastards we were fuckin’ big bastards that’s what the beatles were you have to be a bastard to make it that’s a fact and the beatles are the biggest bastards on earth  everybody wants the image to carry on you want to carry on the press around too because they want the free drinks and the free whores and the fun; everybody wants to keep on the bandwagon we were the caesars; who was going to knock us when there were a million pounds to be made all the handouts the bribery the police all the fucking hype everybody wanted in that’s why some of them are still trying to cling on to this don’t take rome from us not a portable rome where we can all have our houses and our cars and our lovers and our wives and office girls and parties and drink and drugs don’t take it from us otherwise you’re mad john you’re crazy silly john wants to take this all away  when we came down we were treated like real provincials by the londoners we were in fact provincials  that was a great period we were like kings of the jungle then and we were very close to the stones i don’t know how close the others were but i spent a lot of time with brian and mick i admire them you know i dug them the first time i saw them in whatever that place is they came from richmond i spent a lot of time with them and it was great we all used to just go around london in cars and meet each other and talk about music with the animals and eric and all that it was really a good time that was the best period fame-wise we didn’t get mobbed so much it was like a men’s smoking club just a very good scene  well he was different over the years as he disintegrated he ended up the kind of guy that you dread when he would come on the phone because you knew it was trouble he was really in a lot of pain in the early days he was all right because he was young and confident he was one of them guys that disintegrated in front of you he wasn’t sort of brilliant or anything he was just a nice guy  by then i didn’t feel anything i just thought another victim of the drug scene  i think it’s a lot of hype i like honky tonk woman but i think mick’s a joke with all that fag dancing i always did i enjoy it i’ll probably go and see his films and all like everybody else but really i think it’s a joke  no i never do see him we saw a bit of each other around when allen was first coming in–i think mick got jealous i was always very respectful about mick and the stones but he said a lot of sort of tarty things about the beatles which i am hurt by because you know i can knock the beatles but don’t let mick jagger knock them i would like to just list what we did and what the stones did two months after on every fuckin’ album every fuckin’ thing we did mick does exactly the same–he imitates us and i would like one of you fuckin’ underground people to point it out you know satanic majesties is pepper we love you it’s the most fuckin’ bullshit that’s all you need is love  yeah yeah and rubber soul too and revolver  i don’t remember it did it pan it  i don’t remember in those days reviews weren’t very important because we had it made whatever happened nowadays i’m as sensitive as shit but those days we were too big to touch i don’t remember the reviews at all i never read them we were so blasé we never even read the news clippings it was a bore to read about us i don’t even remember ever hearing about that review  yeah but there are two ways of thinking they are out to get us or it just happened that way after i started two virgins and doing those kind of things it seemed like i was fair game for the police there was some myth about us being protected because we had an mbe i don’t think that it was true it was just that we never did anything the way paul said the acid thing i never got attacked for it i don’t know whether that was protection because it was openly admitting that we had drugs i just think nobody really bothered about us  i can be but i don’t wish to be there is no reason on earth why i should be without her there is nothing more important than our relationship nothing we dig being together all the time and both of us could survive apart but what for i’m not going to sacrifice love real love for any fuckin’ whore or any friend or any business because in the end you’re alone at night neither of us want to be and you can’t fill the bed with groupies i don’t want to be a swinger like i said in the song i’ve been through it all and nothing works better than to have somebody you love hold you  i said a lot of things i write songs because that’s the thing i chose to do and i can’t help writing them that’s a fact sometimes i felt as though you worked to justify your existence but you don’t; you work to exist and vice versa and that’s it really  yeah creating is a result of pain too i have to put it somewhere and i write songs but when i was hiding in weybridge i used to think i wasn’t working there i made or movies just mm stuff but still movies and many many hours of tape of different sounds just not rocking i suppose you would call them avant-grade that’s how yoko met me there were very few people i could play those tapes to and i played them to her and then we made two virgins a few hours later  i think i’ll be able to control meself control is the wrong word i just won’t get involved in too many things that’s all i’ll just do whatever happens it’s silly to feel guilty that i’m not working that i’m not doing this or that it’s just stupid i’m just going to do what i want for meself and for both of us  because i’m sick of all these aggressive hippies or whatever they are the now generation being very up-tight with me either on the street or anywhere or on the phone demanding my attention as if i owed them something  i don’t know what i thought when it happened a lot of the things he says are true he is a child of the state made by us and he took their children it when nobody else would of course he’s cracked all right  he’s balmy like any other beatle-kind of fan who reads mysticism into it we used to have a laugh about this that or the other in a light-hearted way and some intellectual would read us some symbolic youth generation wants to see something in it we also took seriously some parts of the role but i don’t know what helter skelter has to do with knifing somebody i’ve never listened to the words properly it was just a noise  that’s bullshit i just read that one about dylan too that’s bullshit  i don’t know where that started that’s balmy you know as much about it as me  no that was bullshit the whole thing was made up we wouldn’t do anything like that we did put in like tit tit tit in girl and many things i don’t remember like a beat missing or something like that could be interpreted like that some people have got nothing better to do than study bibles and make myths about it and study rocks and make stories about how people used to live it’s just something for them to do they live vicariously  no we decided that if we were going to do anything like get married or like this film we are going to make now that we would dedicate it to peace and the concept of peace during that period because we are what we are it evolved that somehow we ended up being responsible to produce peace even in our own heads we would get that way that’s how it is peace is still important and my life is dedicated to living–just surviving is what it’s about–really from day to day  i don’t know i can’t measure it somebody else has to tell us what the reaction is  hamrick was brought over by tony because he said this was a great doctor–he hadn’t mentioned the flying saucers until he was on his way–and he was going to hypnotize us so we would stop smoking  we thought great tony said it really worked because it worked on him and it was easy so this big guy comes in who seemed to be primaling all the time–he was always crying a lot and talking–and then he tried it and it didn’t work he talked like crackers and then he said he would put us back into our past life we were game for anything then it’s like going to a fortune teller–so we said all right do it  whatever we make it if we want to go bullshitting off into intellectualism with rock and roll then we are going to get bullshitting rock intellectualism if we want real rock and roll it’s up to all of us to create it and stop being hyped by the revolutionary image and long hair we’ve got to get over that bit that’s what cutting hair is about let’s own up now and see who’s who who is doing something about what and who is making music and who is laying down bullshit rock and roll will be whatever we make it  because the best stuff is primitive enough and has no bullshit it gets through to you it’s beat go to the jungle and they have the rhythm it goes throughout the world and it’s as simple as that you get the rhythm going because everybody goes into it i read that eldridge cleaver said that blacks gave the middle class whites back their bodies and put their minds and bodies together something like that it gets through; it got through to me the only thing to get through to me of all the things that were happening when i was  rock and roll then was real everything else was unreal the thing about rock and roll good rock and roll–whatever good means and all that shit–is that it’s real and realism gets through to you despite yourself you recognize something in it which is true like all true art whatever art is readers ok if it’s real it’s simple usually and if it’s simple it’s true something like that rock and roll finally got through to yoko  if somebody starts playing that intellectual on me i’m going to start thinking i’m a very shy person; if somebody attacks i shrink yoko is an intellectual a supreme intellectual so i really know what i’m talking about; they have to have sort of a math formula  well it will never be as new and it will never again do what it did to me then but like tutti fruitti or long tall sally is pretty avant garde a friend of yoko’s in the village was talking about dylan and the one note as though he just discovered it that’s about as far out as you can get  it means a lot of things there is not one thing that’s beatle music how can they talk about it like that what is beatle music walrus or penny lane which it’s too diverse i want to hold your hand or revolution number nine  we didn’t sound like everybody else we didn’t sound like the black musicians because we weren’t black and we were brought up on an entirely different type of music and atmosphere so please please me and from me to you and all of those were our version of the chair we were building our own chairs that’s all and they were sort of local chairs  it was awful i hated it some of them were good but i didn’t like hollywood bowl some of those big gigs were good but not many of them  yeah i liked it because it was a slightly new sound at the time but it’s not my favorite song  it was pretty fuckin’ heavy for then it’s a heavy record that’s why i like it i used to like guitars  i am the walrus was originally the b side of hello goodbye! i was still in my love cloud with yoko and i thought well i’ll just say something nice to paul it’s all right you did a good job over these few years holding us together he was trying to organize the group and organize the music and be an individual and all that so i wanted to thank him i said the walrus is paul for that reason i felt well he can have it i’ve got yoko and thank you you can have the credit  i liked the a side but i never liked that sort of pop opera on the other side i think it’s junk because it was just bits of songs thrown together come together is all right that’s all i remember that was my song it was a competent album like rubber soul it was together in that way but abbey road had no life in it  it was great i wrote it in the morning on the piano i went to the office and sang it many times so i said hell let’s do it and we booked the studio and phil came in and said how do you want it i said you know ’s he said right and boom i did it in about three goes or something like that i went in and he played it back and there it was the only argument was that i said a bit more bass that’s all; and off we went  oh some time or other there was a period when we started realizing that you could go and remix it yourself we started listening to them and started saying well why can’t you do that we’d be just standing by the board saying well what about that and george martin would say well how do you like this in the early days they just would present us with finished product we would ask what happened to the bass or something and they would say oh that’s how it is you can’t that kind of thing it must have been a gradual thing  as a record  the record was beautiful  that is what it is for you know i remember hearing them all sing it–i don’t know whether it was on the radio or tv–it was a very big moment for me that’s what the song was about  it’s really just revolutionary i think its concept is revolutionary and i hope it’s for workers and not for tarts and fags i hope it’s what give peace a chance was about but i don’t know on the other hand it might just be ignored  i keep thinking mother is a commercial record because all the time i was writing it it was the one i was singing the most it’s the one that seemed to catch on in my head i’m convinced that mother is a commercial record  you agree well thank you but you said god  they’re all playing god or isolation  it’s the politics in it too politics will prepare the ground for my album same as my sweet lord prepared the ground for george’s i’m not going to get hits just like that; people are not just going to buy my album just because rolling stone liked it or because they’re going to play it tonight or because pete’s a good pusher people have got to be hyped in a way they’ve got to have it presented to them in all the best ways that are possible maybe love is the best way i like the song love; i like the melody and the words and everything i think its beautiful but i’m more of a rocker i originally conceived of mother and love as being a single but now i think that mother is too heavy maybe allen’s right love will do me more good  i’m opening a door for john lennon not for music or for the beatles or for anybody or anything  the implications are all money–all of it is money man they’ve been hinting around they’ve been saying well now this looks like a john lennon album not plastic ono well to me it’s plastic ono or i wouldn’t put it out like that  how quick do you get to number one the thing is love would attract more people because of the message man! there are many many people who would not like mother it hurts them the first thing that happens to you when you get the album is you can’t take it everybody’s reacted exactly the same they think fuck that’s how everybody is the second time they start saying oh there’s a little so if i laid mother on them it confirms the suspicion that something nasty is going on with that john lennon and his broad again  the ones on which i play guitar i wrote on guitar; the ones on which i play piano i wrote on piano  because i can play the piano even worse than i play the guitar–a limited palette as they call it–i surprise myself i have to think in terms of going from c to a and i’m not quite sure where i am half the time when i’m holding a chord on the guitar it’s only a sixth or seventh or something like that; on the piano i don’t know what it is it’s got that kind of feel about it i know such a lot about the guitar that with it i can be buskin’; if i want to write just a rocker i have to play guitar because i can’t play piano well enough to inspire me to rock that’s the difference really  ever the one best song  i don’t know if somebody asked me what is my favorite song is it stardust or something i can’t answer that kind of decision-making i can’t do i always liked walrus strawberry fields help in my life those are some favorites  because i meant it–it’s real the lyric is as good now as it was then it is no different and it makes me feel secure to know that i was that aware of myself then it was just me singing help and i meant it  no that’s just the ones i happen to like i like to read other people’s lyrics too  it was another one like magical mystery tour in a nutshell it was time for another beatle movie or something; paul wanted us to go on the road or do something he sort of set it up and there were discussions about where to go and all of that i had yoko by them and i would just tag along i was stoned all the time and i just didn’t give a shit nobody did it was just like it was in the movie; when i got to do across the universe  paul yawns and plays boogie i merely say anyone want to do a fast one that’s how i am year after year that begins to wear you down  oh fuckin’ god knows how long paul had this idea that he was going to rehearse us he’s looking for perfection all the time and had these ideas that we would rehearse and then make the album we being lazy fuckers–and we’d been playing for years! we’re grown men for fuck’s sake and we’re not going to sit around and rehearse i’m not anyway –we couldn’t get into it  the tape ended up like the bootleg version we didn’t want to know about it anymore so we just left it to glyn johns and said here mix it that was the first time since the first album that we didn’t want to have anything to do with it none of us could be bothered going in nobody called anybody about it and the tapes were left there glyn johns did it we got an acetate in the mail and we called each other and said what do you think  there were so many clashes it did come out at the same time or something didn’t it i think he wanted to show he was the beatles  very i expected just a little more if paul and i are sort of disagreeing and i feel weak i think he must feel strong you know that’s in an argument not that we’ve had much physical argument you know  i think it’ll probably scare him into doing something decent and then he’ll scare me into doing something decent like that  that was our version of what was happening people were sort of touching us as we walked past that kind of thing wherever we went we were supposed to be not like normal and we were supposed to put up with all sorts of shit from lord mayors and their wives be touched and pawed like hard day’s night only a million more times like at the american embassy or the british embassy in washington here or wherever it was when some bloody animal cut ringo’s hair i walked out of that swearing at all of them i’d forgotten but you tripped me off into that one what was the question  wherever we went on tour in britain and everywhere we went there were always a few seats laid aside for cripples and people in wheelchairs because we were famous we were supposed to have epileptics and whatever they are in our dressing room all the time we were supposed to be sort of good and really you wanted to be alone you don’t know what to say because they’re usually saying i’ve got your record or they can’t speak and just want to touch you it’s always the mother or the nurse pushing them on you they themselves would just say hello and go away but the mothers would push them at you like you were christ or something as if there were some aura about you which would rub off on them it just got to be like that and we were very sort of callous about it it was just dreadful you would open up every night and instead of seeing kids there you would just see a row full of cripples along the front it seemed that we were just surrounded by cripples and blind people all the time and when we would go through corridors they would be all touching us and things like that it was horrifying  yeah well as naive as in his own write  well i mean we knew what the game was  it was the in joke that we were supposed to cure them; it was the kind of thing that we would say because it was a cruel thing to say we felt sorry for them anybody would but there is a kind of embarrassment when you’re surrounded by blind deaf and crippled people there is only so much we could say you know with the pressure on us to do and to perform  a day in the life  i read the news today oh boy about a lucky man who made the grade and though the news was rather sad i just had to laugh i saw the photograph he blew his mind out in a car he didnt notice that the lights had changed a crowd a people stood and stared theyd seen his face before nobody was really sure

will find away gather round all you clowns let me hear you say hey youve got to hide your love away! hey youve got to hide your love away! i've been baking bread and looking after the baby  that's like what everyone else who has asked me that question over the last few years says 'but what else have you been doing' to which i say 'are you kidding' because bread and babies as every housewife knows is a full-time job after i made the loaves i felt like i had conquered something but as i watched the bread being eaten i thought well jesus don't i get a gold record or knighted or nothing  there were many reasons i had been under obligation or contract from the time i was until well into my s after all those years it was all i knew i wasn't free i was boxed in my contract was the physical manifestation of being in prison it was more important to face myself and face that reality than to continue a life of rock 'n' roll and to go up and down with the whims of either your own performance or the public's opinion of you rock 'n' roll was not fun anymore i chose not to take the standard options in my business going to vegas and singing your great hits if you're lucky or going to hell which is where elvis went  you get the big prize when you get cancer and you have been drawing circles and triangles for ten years i had become a craftsman and i could have continued being a craftsman i respect craftsmen but i am not interested in becoming one  yeah to churn them out because i was expected to like so many people who put out an album every six months because they're supposed to  not only paul but i had lost the initial freedom of the artist by becoming enslaved to the image of what the artist is supposed to do a lot of artists kill themselves because of it whether it is through drink like dylan thomas or through insanity like van gogh or through vd like gauguin  most people don't live with yoko ono  most people don't have a companion who will tell the truth and refuse to live with a bullshit artist which i am pretty good at i can bullshit myself and everybody around yoko that's my answer  she showed me the possibility of the alternative 'you don't have to do this' 'i don't really but-but-but-but-but' of course it wasn't that simple and it didn't sink in overnight it took constant reinforcement walking away is much harder than carrying on i've done both on demand and on schedule i had turned out records from to  walking away seemed like what the guys go through at  when suddenly they're supposed to not exist anymore and they're sent out of the office 'your life is over time for golf'  when i was cleaning the cat shit and feeding sean she was sitting in rooms full of smoke with men in three-piece suits that they couldn't button  we had to face the business it was either another case of asking some daddy to come solve our business or having one of us do it those lawyers were getting a quarter of a million dollars a year to sit around a table and eat salmon at the plaza most of them didn't seem interested in solving the problems every lawyer had a lawyer each beatle had four or five people working so we felt we had to look after that side of the business and get rid of it and deal with it before we could start dealing with our own life and the only one of us who has the talent or the ability to deal with it on that level is yoko  there was a bit of an attitude that this is john's wife but surely she can't really be representing him  they can't stand it but they have to stand it because she is who represents us they're all male you know just big and fat vodka lunch shouting males like trained dogs trained to attack all the time recently she made it possible for us to earn a large sum of money that benefited all of them and they fought and fought not to let her do it because it was her idea and she was a woman and she was not a professional but she did it and then one of the guys said to her 'well lennon does it again' but lennon didn't have anything to do with it  you breathe in and you breathe out we feel like doing it and we have something to say also yoko and i attempted a few times to make music together but that was a long time ago and people still had the idea that the beatles were some kind of sacred thing that shouldn't step outside its circle it was hard for us to work together then we think either people have forgotten or they have grown up by now so we can make a second foray into that place where she and i are together making music simply that it's not like i'm some wondrous mystic prince from the rock-'n'-roll world dabbling in strange music with this exotic oriental dragon lady which was the picture projected by the press before  that's ridiculous people always said john and yoko would do anything for the publicity in the newsweek article it says the reporter asked us 'why did you go underground' well she never asked it that way and i didn't go underground i just stopped talking to the press it got to be pretty funny i was calling myself greta hughes or howard garbo through that period but still the gossip items never stopped we never stopped being in the press but there seemed to be more written about us when we weren't talking to the press than when we were  we are both sensitive people and we were hurt a lot by it i mean we couldn't understand it when you're in love when somebody says something like 'how can you be with that woman' you say 'what do you mean i am with this goddess of love the fulfillment of my whole life why are you saying this why do you want to throw a rock at her or punish me for being in love with her' our love helped us survive it but some of it was pretty violent there were a few times when we nearly went under but we managed to survive and here we are thank you thank you thank you  well that's rubbish you know nobody controls me i'm uncontrollable the only one who controls me is me and that's just barely possible  listen if somebody's gonna impress me whether it be a maharishi or a yoko ono there comes a point when the emperor has no clothes there comes a point when i will see so for all you folks out there who think that i'm having the wool pulled over my eyes well that's an insult to me not that you think less of yoko because that's your problem what i think of her is what counts! because fuck you brother and sister you don't know what's happening i'm not here for you i'm here for me and her and the baby!  well you're always insulted my dear wife it's natural  she doesn't need me  she doesn't need a beatle who needs a beatle  but people do say that  they want to hold on to something they never had in the first place anybody who claims to have some interest in me as an individual artist or even as part of the beatles has absolutely misunderstood everything i ever said if they can't see why i'm with yoko and if they can't see that they don't see anything they're just jacking off to it could be anybody mick jagger or somebody else let them go jack off to mick jagger ok i don't need it  i absolutely don't need it let them chase wings just forget about me if that's what you want go after paul or mick i ain't here for that if that's not apparent in my past i'm saying it in black and green next to all the tits and asses on page  go play with the other boys don't bother me go play with the rolling wings  no wait a minute let's stay with this a second; sometimes i can't let go of it nobody ever said anything about paul's having a spell on me or my having one on paul! they never thought that was abnormal in those days two guys together or four guys together! why didn't they ever say 'how come those guys don't split up i mean what's going on backstage what is this paul and john business how can they be together so long' we spent more time together in the early days than john and yoko the four of us sleeping in the same room practically in the same bed in the same truck living together night and day eating shitting and pissing together! all right doing everything together! nobody said a damn thing about being under a spell maybe they said we were under the spell of brian epstein or george martin there's always somebody who has to be doing something to you you know they're congratulating the stones on being together years whoooopee! at least charlie and bill still got their families in the eighties they'll be asking 'why are those guys still together can't they hack it on their own why do they have to be surrounded by a gang is the little leader scared somebody's gonna knife him in the back' that's gonna be the question that's-a-gonna be the question! they're gonna look back at the beatles and the stones and all those guys as relics the days when those bands were just all men will be on the newsreels you know they will be showing pictures of the guy with lipstick wriggling his ass and the four guys with the evil black make-up on their eyes trying to look raunchy that's gonna be the joke in the future not a couple singing together or living and working together it's all right when you're   to have male companions and idols ok it's tribal and it's gang and it's fine but when it continues and you're still doing it when you're  that means you're still in the head  it was in in england i'd been told about this 'event' this japanese avant-garde artist coming from america i was looking around the gallery and i saw this ladder and climbed up and got a look in this spyglass on the top of the ladder you feel like a fool and it just said 'yes' now at the time all the avant-garde was smash the piano with a hammer and break the sculpture and anti- anti- anti- anti- anti it was all boring negative crap you know and just that yes made me stay in a gallery full of apples and nails there was a sign that said hammer a nail in so i said 'can i hammer a nail in' but yoko said no because the show wasn't opening until the next day but the owner came up and whispered to her 'let him hammer a nail in you know he's a millionaire he might buy it' and so there was this little conference and finally she said 'ok you can hammer a nail in for five shillings' so smartass says 'well i'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in' and that's when we really met that's when we locked eyes and she got it and i got it and as they say in all the interviews we do the rest is history  of course i was a beatle but things had begun to change in  just before we met i went to almeria spain to make the movie 'how i won the war' it did me a lot of good to get away i was there six weeks i wrote 'strawberry fields forever' there by the way it gave me time to think on my own away from the others from then on i was looking for somewhere to go but i didn't have the nerve to really step out on the boat by myself and push it off but when i fell in love with yoko i knew my god this is different from anything i've ever known this is something other this is more than a hit record more than gold more than everything it is indescribable  as i said i had already begun to want to leave but when i met yoko is like when you meet your first woman you leave the guys at the bar you don't go play football anymore you don't go play snooker or billiards maybe some guys do it on friday night or something but once i found the woman the boys became of no interest whatsoever other than being old school friends 'those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine' we got married three years later in  that was the end of the boys and it just so happened that the boys were well known and weren't just local guys at the bar everybody got so upset over it there was a lot of shit thrown at us a lot of hateful stuff  yoko do you still have to carry that cross that was years ago  i've always thought there was this underlying thing in paul's 'get back' when we were in the studio recording it every time he sang the line 'get back to where you once belonged' he'd look at yoko  no but maybe he'll say i'm paranoid  do you want to go back to high school why should i go back ten years to provide an illusion for you that i know does not exist it cannot exist  why should the beatles give more didn't they give everything on god's earth for ten years didn't they give themselves you're like the typical sort of love-hate fan who says 'thank you for everything you did for us in the sixties would you just give me another shot just one more miracle'  when rodgers worked with hart and then worked with hammerstein do you think he should have stayed with one instead of working with the other should dean martin and jerry lewis have stayed together because i used to like them together what is this game of doing things because other people want it the whole beatle idea was to do what you want right to take your own responsibility  i don't the beatles you see i'm too involved in them artistically i cannot see them objectively i cannot listen to them objectively i'm dissatisfied with every record the beatles ever fucking made there ain't one of them i wouldn't remake including all the beatles records and all my individual ones so i cannot possibly give you an assessment of what the beatles are when i was a beatle i thought we were the best fucking group in the god-damned world and believing that is what made us what we were whether we call it the best rock 'n roll group or the best pop group or whatever but you play me those tracks today and i want to remake every damn one of them there's not a single one i heard 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' on the radio last night it's abysmal you know the track is just terrible i mean it's great but it wasn't made right know what i mean but that's the artistic trip isn't it that's why you keep going but to get back to your original question about the beatles and their music the answer is that we did some good stuff and we did some bad stuff  'imagine' 'love' and those plastic ono band songs stand up to any song that was written when i was a beatle now it may take you or years to appreciate that but the fact is if you check those songs out you will see that it is as good as any fucking stuff that was ever done  well if it was the best so what  it can never be again! everyone always talks about a good thing coming to an end as if life was over but i'll be when this interview comes out paul is  elton john bob dylan we're all relatively young people the game isn't over yet everyone talks in terms of the last record or the last beatle concert but god willing there are another years of productivity to go i'm not judging whether 'i am the walrus' is better or worse than 'imagine' it is for others to judge i am doing it i do i don't stand back and judge i do  wouldn't it be interesting to take elvis back to his sun records period i don't know but i'm content to listen to his sun records i don't want to dig him up out of the grave the beatles don't exist and can never exist again john lennon paul mccartney george harrison and richard starkey could put on a concert but it can never be the beatles singing 'strawberry fields' or 'i am the walrus' again because we are not in our s we cannot be that again nor can the people who are listening  i never went to high school reunions my thing is out of sight out of mind that's my attitude toward life so i don't have any romanticism about any part of my past i think of it only inasmuch as it gave me pleasure or helped me grow psychologically that is the only thing that interests me about yesterday i don't believe in yesterday by the way you know i don't believe in yesterday i am only interested in what i am doing now  if they didn't understand the beatles and the sixties then what the fuck could we do for them now do we have to divide the fish and the loaves for the multitudes again do we have to get crucified again do we have to do the walking on water again because a whole pile of dummies didn't see it the first time or didn't believe it when they saw it you know that's what they're asking 'get off the cross i didn't understand the first bit yet can you do that again' no way you can never go home it doesn't exist  well i heard some beatles stuff on the radio the other day and i heard 'green onion' no 'glass onion' i don't even know my own songs! i listened to it because it was a rare track  yeah that line was a joke you know that line was put in partly because i was feeling guilty because i was with yoko and i knew i was finally high and dry in a perverse way i was sort of saying to paul 'here have this crumb have this illusion have this stroke because i'm leaving you' anyway it's a song they don't usually play when a radio station has a beatles weekend they usually play the same ten songs 'a hard day's night' 'help!' 'yesterday' 'something' 'let it be' you know there's all that wealth of material but we hear only ten songs so the deejay says 'i want to thank john paul george and ringo for not getting back together and spoiling a good thing' i thought it was a good sign maybe people are catching on  oh yeah paul and i were together watching that show he was visiting us at our place in the dakota we were watching it and almost went down to the studio just as a gag we nearly got into a cab but we were actually too tired  that was a period when paul just kept turning up at our door with a guitar i would let him in but finally i said to him 'please call before you come over it's not and turning up at the door isn't the same anymore you know just give me a ring' he was upset by that but i didn't mean it badly i just meant that i was taking care of a baby all day and some guy turns up at the door but anyway back on that night he and linda walked in and he and i were just sitting there watching the show and we went 'ha-ha wouldn't it be funny if we went down' but we didn't  yes but i didn't mean it like that  we're neither i haven't seen any of the beatles for i don't know how much time somebody asked me what i thought of paul's last album and i made some remark like i thought he was depressed and sad but then i realized i hadn't listened to the whole damn thing i heard one track the hit 'coming up' which i thought was a good piece of work then i heard something else that sounded like he was depressed but i don't follow their work i don't follow wings you know i don't give a shit what wings is doing or what george's new album is doing or what ringo is doing i'm not interested no more than i am in what elton john or bob dylan is doing it's not callousness it's just that i'm too busy living my own life to be following what other people are doing whether they're the beatles or guys i went to college with or people i had intense relationships with before i met the beatles  i kind of admire the way paul started back from scratch forming a new band and playing in small dance halls because that's what he wanted to do with the beatles he wanted us to go back to the dance halls and experience that again but i didn't that was one of the problems in a way that he wanted to relive it all or something i don't know what it was but i kind of admire the way he got off his pedestal now he's back on it again but i mean he did what he wanted to do that's fine but it's just not what i wanted to do  'the long and winding road' was the last gasp from him although i really haven't listened  really talked to him no that's the operative word i haven't really talked to him in ten years because i haven't spent time with him i've been doing other things and so has he you know he's got kids and about  records out how can he spend time talking he's always working  well you could say that he provided a lightness an optimism while i would always go for the sadness the discords a certain bluesy edge there was a period when i thought i didn't write melodies that paul wrote those and i just wrote straight shouting rock 'n roll but of course when i think of some of my own songs 'in my life' or some of the early stuff 'this boy' i was writing melody with the best of them paul had a lot of training could play a lot of instruments he'd say 'well why don't you change that there you've done that note times in the song' you know i'll grab a note and ram it home then again i'd be the one to figure out where to go with a song a story that paul would start in a lot of the songs my stuff is the middle-eight the bridge  take 'michelle' paul and i were staying somewhere and he walked in and hummed the first few bars with the words you know-- and he says 'where do i go from here' i'd been listening to blues singer nina simone who did something like 'i love you!' in one of her songs and that made me think of the middle-eight for 'michelle' 'i love you i love you i lo-ove you'  i always had an easier time with lyrics though paul is quite a capable lyricist who doesn't think he is so he doesn't go for it rather than face the problem he would avoid it 'hey jude' is a damn good set of lyrics i made no contribution to the lyrics there and a couple of lines he has come up with show indications of a good lyricist but he just hasn't taken it anywhere still in the early days we didn't care about lyrics as long as the song had some vague theme she loves you he loves him they all love each other it was the hook line and sound we were going for that's still my attitude but i can't leave lyrics alone i have to make them make sense apart from the songs  in 'we can work it out' paul did the first half i did the middle-eight but you've got paul writing 'we can work it out/we can work it out' --real optimistic y' know and me impatient 'life is very short and there's no time/for fussing and fighting my friend'  sure well i was always like that you know i was like that before the beatles and after the beatles i always asked why people did things and why society was like it was i didn't just accept it for what it was apparently doing i always looked below the surface  yeah i was lying it was when i felt resentful so i felt that we did everything apart but actually a lot of the songs we did eyeball to eyeball  yeah 'sgt pepper' was paul's idea and i remember he worked on it a lot and suddenly called me to go into the studio said it was time to write some songs on 'pepper' under the pressure of only ten days i managed to come up with 'lucy in the sky' and 'day in the life' we weren't communicating enough you see and later on that's why i got resentful about all that stuff but now i understand that it was just the same competitive game going on  in the early days we'd make a record in hours or something; they would want a single every three months and we'd have to write it in a hotel room or in a van so the cooperation was functional as well as musical  i never actually felt a loss i don't want it to sound negative like i didn't need paul because when he was there obviously it worked but i can't it's easier to say what i gave to him than what he gave to me and he'd say the same  you know i wasn't really feeling that vicious at the time but i was using my resentment toward paul to create a song let's put it that way he saw that it pointedly refers to him and people kept hounding him about it but you know there were a few digs on his album before mine he's so obscure other people didn't notice them but i heard them i thought well i'm not obscure i just get right down to the nitty-gritty so he'd done it his way and i did it mine but as to the line you quoted yeah i think paul died creatively in a way  i don't know whether this will gel for you when the beatles played in america for the first time they played pure craftsmanship meaning they were already old hands the jism had gone out of the performances a long time ago in the same respect the songwriting creativity had left paul and me in the mid-sixties when we wrote together in the early days it was like the beginning of a relationship lots of energy in the 'sgt pepper'- 'abbey road' period the relationship had matured maybe had we gone on together more interesting things would have come but it couldn't have been the same  ringo was a star in his own right in liverpool before we even met he was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had ringo starr-time and he was in one of the top groups in britain but especially in liverpool before we even had a drummer so ringo's talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other i don't know what he would have ended up as but whatever that spark is in ringo that we all know but can't put our finger on whether it is acting drumming or singing i don't know there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the beatles ringo is a damn good drummer he is not technically good but i think ringo's drumming is underrated the same way paul's bass playing is underrated paul was one of the most innovative bass players ever and half the stuff that is going on now is directly ripped off from his beatles period he is an egomaniac about everything else about himself but his bass playing he was always a bit coy about i think paul and ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians not technically great none of us are technical musicians none of us could read music none of us can write it but as pure musicians as inspired humans to make the noise they are as good as anybody  i think 'all things must pass' was all right it just went on too long  well he walked right into it he knew what he was doing  he must have known you know he's smarter than that it's irrelevant actually only on a monetary level does it matter he could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him but he just let it go and paid the price maybe he thought god would just sort of let him off  well i was hurt by george's book 'i me mine' so this message will go to him he put a book out privately on his life that by glaring omission says that my influence on his life is absolutely zilch and nil in his book which is purportedly this clarity of vision of his influence on each song he wrote he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years i'm not in the book  because george's relationship with me was one of young follower and older guy he's three or four years younger than me it's a love/hate relationship and i think george still bears resentment toward me for being a daddy who left home he would not agree with this but that's my feeling about it i was just hurt i was just left out as if i didn't exist i don't want to be that egomaniacal but he was like a disciple of mine when we started i was already an art student when paul and george were still in grammar school there is a vast difference between being in high school and being in college and i was already in college and already had sexual relationships already drank and did a lot of things like that when george was a kid he used to follow me and my first girlfriend cynthia who became my wife around we'd come out of art school and he'd be hovering around like those kids at the gate of the dakota now i remember the day he called to ask for help on 'taxman' one of his bigger songs i threw in a few one-liners to help the song along because that's what he asked for he came to me because he couldn't go to paul because paul wouldn't have helped him at that period i didn't want to do it i thought oh no don't tell me i have to work on george's stuff it's enough doing my own and paul's but because i loved him and i didn't want to hurt him when he called me that afternoon and said 'will you help me with this song' i just sort of bit my tongue and said ok it had been john and paul so long he'd been left out because he hadn't been a songwriter up until then as a singer we allowed him only one track on each album if you listen to the beatles' first albums the english versions he gets a single track the songs he and ringo sang at first were the songs that used to be part of my repertoire in the dance halls i used to pick songs for them from my repertoire the easier ones to sing so i am slightly resentful of george's book but don't get me wrong i still love those guys the beatles are over but john paul george and ringo go on  'i'm the greatest' it was the muhammad ali line of course it was perfect for ringo to sing if i said 'i'm the greatest' they'd all take it so seriously no one would get upset with ringo singing it  yeah except when george and billy preston started saying 'let's form a group let's form a group' i was embarrassed when george kept asking me he was just enjoying the session and the spirit was very good but i was with yoko you know we took time out from what we were doing the very fact that they would imagine i would form a male group without yoko! it was still in their minds  i don't want to have anything to do with benefits i have been benefited to death  because they're always rip-offs i haven't performed for personal gain since  when the beatles last performed every concert since then yoko and i did for specific charities except for a toronto thing that was a rock 'n roll revival every one of them was a mess or a rip-off so now we give money to who we want you've heard of tithing  right i am just going to do it privately i am not going to get locked into that business of saving the world on stage the show is always a mess and the artist always comes off badly  bangladesh was ca-ca  yeah right i can't even talk about it because it's still a problem you'll have to check with mother because she knows the ins and outs of it i don't but it's all a rip-off so forget about it all of you who are reading this don't bother sending me all that garbage about 'just come and save the indians come and save the blacks come and save the war veterans' anybody i want to save will be helped through our tithing which is ten percent of whatever we earn  that was a commercial for sid bernstein written with jewish schmaltz and showbiz and tears dropping on one knee it was al jolson ok so i don't buy that ok  where do people get off saying the beatles should give $ to south america you know america has poured billions into places like that it doesn't mean a damn thing after they've eaten that meal then what it lasts for only a day after the $ is gone then what it goes round and round in circles you can pour money in forever after peru then harlem then britain there is no one concert we would have to dedicate the rest of our lives to one world concert tour and i'm not ready for it not in this lifetime anyway  we never admitted anything  what the post says ok so we are rich; so what  in england there are only two things to be basically you are either for the labor movement or for the capitalist movement either you become a right-wing archie bunker if you are in the class i am in or you become an instinctive socialist which i was that meant i think people should get their false teeth and their health looked after all the rest of it but apart from that i worked for money and i wanted to be rich so what the hell if that's a paradox then i'm a socialist but i am not anything what i used to be is guilty about money that's why i lost it either by giving it away or by allowing myself to be screwed by so-called managers  sean and i were away for a weekend and yoko came over to sell this cow and i was joking about it we hadn't seen her for days; she spent all her time on it but then i read the paper that said she sold it for a quarter of a million dollars only yoko could sell a cow for that much  they're good business  what would you suggest i do give everything away and walk the streets the buddhist says 'get rid of the possessions of the mind' walking away from all the money would not accomplish that it's like the beatles i couldn't walk away from the beatles that's one possession that's still tagging along right if i walk away from one house or houses i'm not gonna escape it  it takes time to get rid of all this garbage that i've been carrying around that was influencing the way i thought and the way i lived it had a lot to do with yoko showing me that i was still possessed i left physically when i fell in love with yoko but mentally it took the last ten years of struggling i learned everything from her  it is a teacher-pupil relationship that's what people don't understand she's the teacher and i'm the pupil i'm the famous one the one who's supposed to know everything but she's my teacher she's taught me everything i fucking know she was there when i was nowhere when i was the nowhere man she's my don juan that's what people don't understand i'm married to fucking don juan that's the hardship of it don juan doesn't have to laugh; don juan doesn't have to be charming; don juan just is and what goes on around don juan is irrelevant to don juan  no a don juan doesn't have a following a don juan isn't in the newspaper and doesn't have disciples and doesn't proselytize  when don juan said when don ono said 'get out! because you're not getting it' well it was like being sent into the desert and the reason she wouldn't let me back in was because i wasn't ready to come back in i had to settle things within myself when i was ready to come back in she let me back in and that's what i'm living with  yes we were separated in the early seventies she kicked me out suddenly i was on a raft alone in the middle of the universe  well at first i thought whoopee whoopee! you know bachelor life! whoopee! and then i woke up one day and i thought what is this i want to go home! but she wouldn't let me come home that's why it was months apart instead of six months we were talking all the time on the phone and i would say 'i don't like this i'm getting in trouble and i'd like to come home please' and she would say 'you're not ready to come home' so what do you say ok back to the bottle  she has her ways whether they be mystical or practical when she said it's not ready it ain't ready  i was just trying to hide what i felt in the bottle i was just insane it was the lost weekend that lasted months i've never drunk so much in my life i tried to drown myself in the bottle and i was with the heaviest drinkers in the business  such as harry nilsson bobby keyes keith moon we couldn't pull ourselves out we were trying to kill ourselves i think harry might still be trying poor bugger god bless you harry wherever you are but jesus you know i had to get away from that because somebody was going to die well keith did it was like who's going to die first unfortunately keith was the one  for me it was because of being apart i couldn't stand it they had their own reasons and it was let's all drown ourselves together from where i was sitting it looked like that let's kill ourselves but do it like errol flynn you know the macho male way it's embarrassing for me to think about that period because i made a big fool of myself but maybe it was a good lesson for me i wrote 'nobody loves you when you're down and out' during that time that's how i felt it exactly expresses the whole period for some reason i always imagined sinatra singing that one i don't know why it's kind of a sinatraesque song really he would do a perfect job with it are you listening frank you need a song that isn't a piece of nothing here's the one for you the horn arrangement and everything's made for you but don't ask me to produce it  the stories were all so exaggerated but we were all in a restaurant drinking not eating as usual at those gatherings and i happened to go take a pee and there was a brand-new fresh kotex not tampax on the toilet you know the old trick where you put a penny on your forehead and it sticks i was a little high and i just picked it up and slapped it on and it stayed you see i walked out of the bathroom and i had a kotex on my head big deal everybody went 'ha-ha-ha' and it fell off but the press blew it up  yoko looks upon men as assistants of varying degrees of intimacy but basically assistants and this one's going to take a pee  when yoko and i started doing stuff together we would hold press conferences and announce our whatevers we're going to wear bags or whatever and before this one press conference one beatle assistant in the upper echelon of beatle assistants leaned over to yoko and said you know you don't have to work you've got enough money now that you're mrs lennon' and when she complained to me about it i couldn't understand what she was talking about 'but this guy' i'd say 'he's just good old charley or whatever he's been with us years' the same kind of thing happened in the studio she would say to an engineer 'i'd like a little more treble a little more bass' or 'there's too much of whatever you're putting on' and they'd look at me and say 'what did you say john' those days i didn't even notice it myself now i know what she's talking about in japan when i ask for a cup of tea in japanese they look at yoko and ask 'he wants a cup of tea' in japanese  john-- john is the name  that's john j-o-h-n from johan i believe  she don't suffer fools gladly even if she's married to him  now get that editors you got that word  and we learned that it's better for the family if we are both working for the family she doing the business and me playing mother and wife we reordered our priorities the number-one priority is her and the family everything else revolves around that  only yoko was when she had sean  everybody else becomes a worker/consumer  too late they've got it on tape  big sister-- wait till she comes!  then it's aldous huxley  some of my best friends are organs  back to the album very good  we got back together decided this was our life that having a baby was important to us and that anything else was subsidiary to that we worked hard for that child we went through all hell trying to have a baby through many miscarriages and other problems he is what they call a love child in truth doctors told us we could never have a child we almost gave up 'well that's it then we can't have one' we were told something was wrong with my sperm that i abused myself so much in my youth that there was no chance yoko was  and so they said no way she has had too many miscarriages and when she was a young girl there were no pills so there were lots of abortions and miscarriages; her stomach must be like kew gardens in london no way but this chinese acupuncturist in san francisco said 'you behave yourself no drugs eat well no drink you have child in months' and we said 'but the english doctors said' he said 'forget what they said you have child' we had sean and sent the acupuncturist a polaroid of him just before he died god rest his soul  not because of her age but because of a screw-up in the hospital and the fucking price of fame somebody had made a transfusion of the wrong blood type into yoko i was there when it happened and she starts to go rigid and then shake from the pain and the trauma i run up to this nurse and say 'go get the doctor!' i'm holding on tight to yoko while this guy gets to the hospital room he walks in hardly notices that yoko is going through fucking convulsions goes straight for me smiles shakes my hand and says 'i've always wanted to meet you mr lennon i always enjoyed your music' i start screaming 'my wife's dying and you wanna talk about my music!' christ!  i haven't said anything beatles were never mentioned to him there was no reason to mention it; we never played beatle records around the house unlike the story that went around that i was sitting in the kitchen for the past five years playing beatle records and reliving my past like some kind of howard hughes he did see 'yellow submarine' at a friend's so i had to explain what a cartoon of me was doing in a movie  he doesn't differentiate between the beatles and daddy and mommy he thinks yoko was a beatle too i don't have beatle records on the jukebox he listens to he's more exposed to early rock 'n roll he's into 'hound dog' he thinks it's about hunting sean's not going to public school by the way we feel he can learn the three rs when he wants to or when the law says he has to i suppose i'm not going to fight it otherwise there's no reason for him to be learning to sit still i can't see any reason for it sean now has plenty of child companionship which everybody says is important but he also is with adults a lot he's adjusted to both the reason why kids are crazy is because nobody can face the responsibility of bringing them up everybody's too scared to deal with children all the time so we reject them and send them away and torture them the ones who survive are the conformists their bodies are cut to the size of the suits the ones we label good the ones who don't fit the suits either are put in mental homes or become artists  well cyn got possession or whatever you call it i got rights to see him on his holidays and all that business and at least there's an open line still going it's not the best relationship between father and son but it is there he's now julian and i will have a relationship in the future over the years he's been able to see through the beatle image and to see through the image that his mother will have given him subconsciously or consciously he's interested in girls and autobikes now i'm just sort of a figure in the sky but he's obliged to communicate with me even when he probably doesn't want to  i'm not going to lie to julian ninety percent of the people on this planet especially in the west were born out of a bottle of whiskey on a saturday night and there was no intent to have children so percent of us that includes everybody were accidents i don't know anybody who was a planned child all of us were saturday-night specials julian is in the majority along with me and everybody else sean is a planned child and therein lies the difference i don't love julian any less as a child he's still my son whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days he's here he belongs to me and he always will  it was a classic case of men being macho it turned into me and allen klein trying to dominate tony cox tony's attitude was 'you got my wife but you won't get my child' in this battle yoko and the child were absolutely forgotten i've always felt bad about it it became a case of the shoot-out at the ok corral cox fled to the hills and hid out and the sheriff and i tracked him down first we won custody in court yoko didn't want to go to court but the men klein and i did it anyway  we chased him all over the world god knows where he went so if you're reading this tony let's grow up about it it's gone we don't want to chase you anymore because we've done enough damage  it was like we were after an escaped convict  yoko got steamed into a guilt thing that if she wasn't attacking them with detectives and police and the fbi then she wasn't a good mother looking for her baby she kept saying 'leave them alone leave them alone' but they said you can't do that  i was just going to commit hara-kiri first  when she gets to be in her 's she'll understand that we were idiots and we know we were idiots she might give us a chance  i'll just half-kill myself  oh god it's all coming out  one rule for the men one for the women  but i've said a million hail marys what the hell else can i do  i am her favorite husband  well sometimes you know she'd come home and say 'i'm tired' i'd say only partly tongue in cheek what the fuck do you think i am i'm hours with the baby! do you think that's easy' i'd say 'you're going to take some more interest in the child' i don't care whether it's a father or a mother when i'm going on about pimples and bones and which tv shows to let him watch i would say 'listen this is important i don't want to hear about your $ deal tonight!' i would like both parents to take care of the children but 'how' is a different matter  it's true the saying 'you've come a long way baby' applies more to me than to her as harry nilsson says 'everything is the opposite of what it is isn't it' it's men who've come a long way from even contemplating the idea of equality but although there is this thing called the women's movement society just took a laxative and they've just farted they haven't really had a good shit yet the seed was planted sometime in the late sixties right but the real changes are coming i am the one who has come a long way i was the pig and it is a relief not to be a pig the pressures of being a pig were enormous i don't have any hankering to be looked upon as a sex object a male macho rock 'n roll singer i got over that a long time ago i'm not even interested in projecting that so i like it to be known that yes i looked after the baby and i made bread and i was a househusband and i am proud of it it's the wave of the future and i'm glad to be in on the forefront of that too  it did for this man but don't forget i'm the one who benefited the most from doing it now i can step back and say sean is going to be five years old and i was able to spend his first five years with him and i am very proud of that and come to think of it it looks like i'm going to be and life begins at -- so they promise and i believe it too i feel fine and i'm very excited it's like you know hitting  like 'wow what's going to happen next' only this time we're together  it's a flower a type of freesia but what it means to us is that if two people picture the same image at the same time that is the secret you can be together but projecting two different images and either whoever's the stronger at the time will get his or her fantasy fulfilled or you will get nothing but mishmash  oh yeah that is like when we did the bed-in in toronto in  they all came charging through the door thinking we were going to be screwing in bed of course we were just sitting there with peace signs  our life is our art that's what the bed-ins were when we got married we knew our honeymoon was going to be public anyway so we decided to use it to make a statement we sat in bed and talked to reporters for seven days it was hilarious in effect we were doing a commercial for peace on the front page of the papers instead of a commercial for war  yes we answered questions one guy kept going over the point about hitler 'what do you do about fascists how can you have peace when you've got a hitler' yoko said 'i would have gone to bed with him' she said she'd have needed only ten days with him people loved that one  very briefly it's about very ordinary things between two people the lyrics are direct simple and straight i went through my dylanesque period a long time ago with songs like 'i am the walrus' the trick of never saying what you mean but giving the impression of something more where more or less can be read into it it's a good game  well i like all music depending on what time of day it is i don't like styles of music or people per se i can't say i enjoy the pretenders but i like their hit record i enjoy the b-s because i heard them doing yoko it's great if yoko ever goes back to her old sound they'll be saying 'yeah she's copying the b-s'  i love all this punky stuff it's pure i'm not however crazy about the people who destroy themselves  i hate it it's better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out i don't appreciate worship of dead sid vicious or of dead james dean or of dead john wayne it's the same thing making sid vicious a hero jim morrison it's garbage to me i worship the people who survive gloria swanson greta garbo they're saying john wayne conquered cancer he whipped it like a man you know i'm sorry that he died and all that i'm sorry for his family but he didn't whip cancer it whipped him i don't want sean worshiping john wayne or sid vicious what do they teach you nothing death sid vicious died for what so that we might rock i mean it's garbage you know if neil young admires that sentiment so much why doesn't he do it because he sure as hell faded away and came back many times like all of us no thank you i'll take the living and the healthy  muzak or classical i don't purchase records i do enjoy listening to things like japanese folk music or indian music my tastes are very broad when i was a housewife i just had muzak on background music 'cuz it relaxes you  least of all my own  are you kidding for pleasure i would never listen to them when i hear them i just think of the session it's like an actor watching himself in an old movie when i hear a song i remember the abbey road studio the session who fought with whom where i was sitting banging the tambourine in the corner  no i'm not interested i'm not a fan you see i might like jerry lee lewis singing 'a whole lot a shakin' on the record but i'm not interested in seeing him perform it  i'm always proud and pleased when people do my songs it gives me pleasure that they even attempt them because a lot of my songs aren't that doable i go to restaurants and the groups always play 'yesterday' i even signed a guy's violin in spain after he played us 'yesterday' he couldn't understand that i didn't write the song but i guess he couldn't have gone from table to table playing 'i am the walrus'  it wasn't really me or us it was the times it happened to me when i heard rock 'n roll in the fifties i had no idea about doing music as a way of life until rock 'n' roll hit me  it was 'rock around the clock' i think i enjoyed bill haley but i wasn't overwhelmed by him it wasn't until 'heartbreak hotel' that i really got into it  but what moved the beatles  alright whatever wind was blowing at the time moved the beatles too i'm not saying we weren't flags on the top of a ship; but the whole boat was moving maybe the beatles were in the crow's-nest shouting 'land ho' or something like that but we were all in the same damn boat  this beatles talk bores me to death turn to page   we tuned in to the message that's all i don't mean to belittle the beatles when i say they weren't this they weren't that i'm just trying not to overblow their importance as separate from society and i don't think they were more important than glenn miller or woody herman or bessie smith it was our generation that's all it was sixties music  all music is rehash there are only a few notes just variations on a theme try to tell the kids in the seventies who were screaming to the bee gees that their music was just the beatles redone there is nothing wrong with the bee gees they do a damn good job there was nothing else going on then  the beatles were more intellectual so they appealed on that level too but the basic appeal of the beatles was not their intelligence it was their music it was only after some guy in the 'london times' said there were aeolian cadences in 'it won't be long' that the middle classes started listening to it because somebody put a tag on it  to this day i don't have any idea what they are they sound like exotic birds  for instance  i said 'cranberry sauce' that's all i said some people like ping-pong other people like digging over graves some people will do anything rather than be here now  no no no i had this whole choir saying 'everybody's got one everybody's got one' but when you get people male and female on top of cellos and on top of the beatles' rock 'n roll rhythm section you can't hear what they're saying  anything you name it one penis one vagina one asshole-- you name it  no it has nothing to do with me it's like that guy son of sam who was having these talks with the dog manson was just an extreme version of the people who came up with the 'paul is dead' thing or who figured out that the initials to 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' were lsd and concluded i was writing about acid  my son julian came in one day with a picture he painted about a school friend of his named lucy he had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' simple  the images were from 'alice in wonderland' it was alice in the boat she is buying an egg and it turns into humpty dumpty the woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and i was visualizing that there was also the image of the female who would someday come save me a 'girl with kaleidoscope eyes' who would come out of the sky it turned out to be yoko though i hadn't met yoko yet so maybe it should be 'yoko in the sky with diamonds'  it's all equally irrelevant mine is to do and other people's is to record i suppose does it matter how many drugs were in elvis' body i mean brian epstein's sex life will make a nice 'hollywood babylon' someday but it is irrelevant  i went on holiday to spain with brian which started all the rumors that he and i were having a love affair well it was almost a love affair but not quite it was never consummated but we did have a pretty intense relationship and it was my first experience with someone i knew was a homosexual he admitted it to me we had this holiday together because cyn was pregnant and we left her with the baby and went to spain lots of funny stories you know we used to sit in cafs and brian would look at all the boys and i would ask 'do you like that one do you like this one' it was just the combination of our closeness and the trip that started the rumors  right  it was the first song i wrote that was consciously about my life 'there are places i'll remember/ all my life though some have changed' before we were just writing songs a la everly brothers buddy holly-- pop songs with no more thought to them than that the words were almost irrelevant 'in my life' started out as a bus journey from my house at menlove avenue to town mentioning all the places i could recall i wrote it all down and it was boring so i forgot about it and laid back and these lyrics started coming to me about friends and lovers of the past paul helped with the middle-eight  well we all know about 'yesterday' i have had so much accolade for 'yesterday' that is paul's song of course and paul's baby well done beautiful-- and i never wished i had written it  this is paul with a little help from me 'what do you see when you turn out the light/ i can't tell you but i know it's mine' is mine  the first line was written on one acid trip one weekend the second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend and it was filled in after i met yoko part of it was putting down hare krishna all these people were going on about hare krishna allen ginsberg in particular the reference to 'element'ry penguin' is the elementary naive attitude of going around chanting 'hare krishna' or putting all your faith in any one idol i was writing obscurely a la dylan in those days  it actually was fantastic in stereo but you never hear it all there was too much to get on it was too messy a mix one track was live bbc radio-- shakespeare or something-- i just fed in whatever lines came in  it's from 'the walrus and the carpenter' 'alice in wonderland' to me it was a beautiful poem it never dawned on me that lewis carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system i never went into that bit about what he really meant like people are doing with the beatles' work later i went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy i thought oh shit i picked the wrong guy i should have said 'i am the carpenter' but that wouldn't have been the same would it 'i am the carpenter'  that was written by paul when we were in new york forming apple and he first met linda maybe she's the one who came in the window she must have i don't know somebody came in the window  that's me including the guitar lick with the first feedback ever recorded i defy anybody to find an earlier record unless it is some old blues record from the twenties with feedback on it  paul completely i would never even dream of writing a song like that there are some areas i never think about and that is one of them  just as it sounds i was reading the paper one day and i noticed two stories one was the guinness heir who killed himself in a car that was the main headline story he died in london in a car crash on the next page was a story about holes in blackburn lancashire in the streets that is they were going to fill them all paul's contribution was the beautiful little lick in the song 'i'd love to turn you on' i had the bulk of the song and the words but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldn't use for anything i thought it was a damn good piece of work  reminisce away  paul and i finished that one off for the stones we were taken down by brian to meet them at the club where they were playing in richmond they wanted a song and we went to see what kind of stuff they did paul had this bit of a song and we played it roughly for them and they said 'yeah ok that's our style' but it was only really a lick so paul and i went off in the corner of the room and finished the song off while they were all sitting there talking we came back and mick and keith said 'jesus look at that they just went over there and wrote it' you know right in front of their eyes we gave it to them it was a throwaway ringo sang it for us and the stones did their version it shows how much importance we put on them we weren't going to give them anything great right that was the stones' first record anyway mick and keith said 'if they can write a song so easily we should try it' they say it inspired them to start writing together  strawberry fields is a real place after i stopped living at penny lane i moved in with my auntie who lived in the suburbs in a nice semidetached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all the beatles stories in the class system it was about half a class higher than paul george and ringo who lived in government-subsidized housing we owned our house and had a garden they didn't have anything like that near that home was strawberry fields a house near a boys' reformatory where i used to go to garden parties as a kid with my friends nigel and pete we would go there and hang out and sell lemonade bottles for a penny we always had fun at strawberry fields so that's where i got the name but i used it as an image strawberry fields forever  'with eyes closed misunderstanding all you see' it still goes doesn't it aren't i saying exactly the same thing now the awareness apparently trying to be expressed is-- let's say in one way i was always hip i was hip in kindergarten i was different from the others i was different all my life the second verse goes 'no one i think is in my tree' well i was too shy and self-doubting nobody seems to be as hip as me is what i was saying therefore i must be crazy or a genius-- 'i mean it must be high or low' the next line there was something wrong with me i thought because i seemed to see things other people didn't see i thought i was crazy or an egomaniac for claiming to see things other people didn't see as a child i would say 'but this is going on!' and everybody would look at me as if i was crazy i always was so psychic or intuitive or poetic or whatever you want to call it that i was always seeing things in a hallucinatory way it was scary as a child because there was nobody to relate to neither my auntie nor my friends nor anybody could ever see what i did it was very very scary and the only contact i had was reading about an oscar wilde or a dylan thomas or a vincent van gogh-- all those books that my auntie had that talked about their suffering because of their visions because of what they saw they were tortured by society for trying to express what they were i saw loneliness  only dead people in books lewis carroll certain paintings surrealism had a great effect on me because then i realized that my imagery and my mind wasn't insanity; that if it was insane i belong in an exclusive club that sees the world in those terms surrealism to me is reality psychic vision to me is reality even as a child when i looked at myself in the mirror or when i was   i used to literally trance out into alpha i didn't know what it was called then i found out years later there is a name for those conditions but i would find myself seeing hallucinatory images of my face changing and becoming cosmic and complete it caused me to always be a rebel this thing gave me a chip on the shoulder; but on the other hand i wanted to be loved and accepted part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic musician but i cannot be what i am not because of my attitude all the other boys' parents including paul's father would say 'keep away from him' the parents instinctively recognized what i was which was a troublemaker meaning i did not conform and i would influence their kids which i did i did my best to disrupt every friend's home i had partly maybe it was out of envy that i didn't have this so-called home but i really did i had an auntie and an uncle and a nice suburban home thank you very much hear this auntie she was hurt by a remark paul made recently that the reason i am staying home with sean now is because i never had a family life it's absolute rubbish there were five women who were my family five strong intelligent women five sisters one happened to be my mother my mother was the youngest she just couldn't deal with life she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me and when i was four and a half i ended up living with her elder sister now those women were fantastic one day i might do a kind of 'forsyte saga' just about them that was my first feminist education anyway that knowledge and the fact that i wasn't with my parents made me see that parents are not gods i would infiltrate the other boys' minds paul's parents were terrified of me and my influence simply because i was free from the parents' strangle hold that was the gift i got for not having parents i cried a lot about not having them and it was torture but it also gave me an awareness early i wasn't an orphan though my mother was alive and lived a -minute walk away from me all my life i saw her off and on i just didn't live with her  no she got killed by an off-duty cop who was drunk after visiting my auntie's house where i lived i wasn't there at the time she was just at a bus stop i was  that was another big trauma for me i lost her twice when i was five and i moved in with my auntie and then when she physically died that made me more bitter; the chip on my shoulder i had as a youth got really big then i was just really re-establishing the relationship with her and she was killed  the song is for her and for yoko  i never saw him again until i made a lot of money and he came back   or  i opened the 'daily express' and there he was washing dishes in a small hotel or something very near where i was living in the stockbroker belt outside london he had been writing to me to try to get in contact i didn't want to see him i was too upset about what he'd done to me and to my mother and that he would turn up when i was rich and famous and not bother turning up before so i wasn't going to see him at all but he sort of blackmailed me in the press by saying all this about being a poor man washing dishes while i was living in luxury i fell for it and saw him and we had some kind of relationship he died a few years later of cancer but at  he married a secretary who had been working for the beatles age  and they had a child which i thought was hopeful for a man who had lived his life as a drunk and almost a bowery bum  when 'help' came out in ' i was actually crying out for help most people think it's just a fast rock 'n roll song i didn't realize it at the time; i just wrote the song because i was commissioned to write it for the movie but later i knew i really was crying out for help it was my fat elvis period you see the movie he -- i -- is very fat very insecure and he's completely lost himself and i am singing about when i was so much younger and all the rest looking back at how easy it was now i may be very positive yes yes but i also go through deep depressions where i would like to jump out the window you know it becomes easier to deal with as i get older; i don't know whether you learn control or when you grow up you calm down a little anyway i was fat and depressed and i was crying out for help in those days when the beatles were depressed we had this little chant i would yell out 'where are we going fellows' they would say 'to the top johnny' in pseudo-american voices and i would say 'where is that fellows' and they would say 'to the toppermost of the poppermost' it was some dumb expression from a cheap movie a la 'blackboard jungle' about liverpool johnny was the leader of the gang  the beatles thing had just gone beyond comprehension we were smoking marijuana for breakfast we were well into marijuana and nobody could communicate with us because we were just all glazed eyes giggling all the time in our own world that was the song 'help' i think everything that comes out of a song-- even paul's songs now which are apparently about nothing-- shows something about yourself  part of me suspects that i'm a loser and the other part of me thinks i'm god almighty  the song is self-explanatory the song got banned even though it's antidrug they're so stupid about drugs you know they're not looking at the cause of the drug problem why do people take drugs to escape from what is life so terrible are we living in such a terrible situation that we can't do anything without reinforcement of alcohol tobacco aspirins sleeping pills uppers downers never mind the heroin and cocaine-- they're just the outer fringes of librium and speed  not really if somebody gives me a joint i might smoke it but i don't go after it  i've had cocaine but i don't like it the beatles had lots of it in their day but it's a dumb drug because you have to have another one minutes later your whole concentration goes on getting the next fix really i find caffeine is easier to deal with  not in years a little mushroom or peyote is not beyond my scope you know maybe twice a year or something you don't hear about it anymore but people are still visiting the cosmos we must always remember to thank the cia and the army for lsd that's what people forget everything is the opposite of what it is isn't it harry so get out the bottle boy and relax they invented lsd to control people and what they did was give us freedom sometimes it works in mysterious ways its wonders to perform if you look in the government reports on acid the ones who jumped out the window or killed themselves because of it i think even with art linkletter's daughter it happened to her years later so let's face it she wasn't really on acid when she jumped out the window and i've never met anybody who's had a flashback on acid i've never had a flashback in my life and i took millions of trips in the sixties  we're mostly macrobiotic but sometimes i take the family out for a pizza  macrobiotic people don't believe in the big c whether you take that as a rationalization or not macrobiotics don't believe that smoking is bad for you of course if we die we're wrong  he said it was written about julian he knew i was splitting with cyn and leaving julian then he was driving to see julian to say hello he had been like an uncle and he came up with 'hey jude' but i always heard it as a song to me now i'm sounding like one of those fans reading things into it think about it yoko had just come into the picture he is saying 'hey jude'-- 'hey john' subconsciously he was saying 'go ahead leave me' on a conscious level he didn't want me to go ahead the angel in him was saying 'bless you' the devil in him didn't like it at all because he didn't want to lose his partner  i was lying on the sofa in our house listening to yoko play beethoven's 'moonlight sonata' on the piano suddenly i said 'can you play those chords backward' she did and i wrote 'because' around them the song sounds like 'moonlight sonata' too the lyrics are clear no bullshit no imagery no obscure references  all we were saying was give peace a chance  no i don't even know why his name was on it it's there because i kind of felt guilty because i'd made the separate single-- the first-- and i was really breaking away from the beatles  paul and i made a deal when we were  there was never a legal deal between us just a deal we made when we decided to write together that we put both our names on it no matter what  the idea came from this thing my mother used to sing to me when i was one or two years old when she was still living with me it was from a disney movie 'do you want to know a secret promise not to tell you are standing by a wishing well' so with that in my head i wrote the song and just gave it to george to sing i thought it would be a good vehicle for him because it had only three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the world he has improved a lot since then; but in those days his ability was very poor i gave it to him just to give him a piece of the action that's another reason why i was hurt by his book i even went to the trouble of making sure he got the b side of a beatles single because he hadn't had a b side of one until 'do you want to know a secret' 'something' was the first time he ever got an a side because paul and i always wrote both sides that wasn't because we were keeping him out but simply because his material was not up to scratch i made sure he got the b side of 'something' too so he got the cash those little things he doesn't remember i always felt bad that george and ringo didn't get a piece of the publishing when the opportunity came to give them five percent each of maclen it was because of me they got it it was not because of klein and not because of paul but because of me when i said they should get it paul couldn't say no i don't get a piece of any of george's songs or ringo's i never asked for anything for the contributions i made to george's songs like 'taxman' not even the recognition and that is why i might have sounded resentful about george and ringo because it was after all those things that the attitude of 'john has forsaken us' and 'john is tricking us' came out which is not true  no it's not about heroin a gun magazine was sitting there with a smoking gun on the cover and an article that i never read inside called 'happiness is a warm gun' i took it right from there i took it as the terrible idea of just having shot some animal  well it was at the beginning of my relationship with yoko and i was very sexually oriented then when we weren't in the studio we were in bed  i call yoko mother or madam just in an offhand way the rest doesn't mean anything it's just images of her  the beatles didn't make a good record of 'across the universe' i think subconsciously we i thought paul subconsciously tried to destroy my great songs we would play experimental games with my great pieces like 'strawberry fields' which i always felt was badly recorded it worked but it wasn't what it could have been i allowed it though we would spend hours doing little detailed cleaning up on paul's songs but when it came to mine especially a great song like 'strawberry fields' or 'across the universe' somehow an atmosphere of looseness and experimentation would come up  subconscious sabotage i was too hurt paul will deny it because he has a bland face and will say this doesn't exist this is the kind of thing i'm talking about where i was always seeing what was going on and began to think well maybe i'm paranoid but it is not paranoid it is the absolute truth the same thing happened to 'across the universe' the song was never done properly the words stand luckily  it is a diary form of writing all that 'i used to be cruel to my woman i beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved' was me i used to be cruel to my woman and physically any woman i was a hitter i couldn't express myself and i hit i fought men and i hit women that is why i am always on about peace you see it is the most violent people who go for love and peace everything's the opposite but i sincerely believe in love and peace i am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence i will have to be a lot older before i can face in public how i treated women as a youngster  we recorded the song twice the beatles were getting really tense with one another i did the slow version and i wanted it out as a single as a statement of the beatles' position on vietnam and the beatles' position on revolution for years on the beatle tours epstein had stopped us from saying anything about vietnam or the war and he wouldn't allow questions about it but on one tour i said 'i am going to answer about the war we can't ignore it' i absolutely wanted the beatles to say something the first take of 'revolution' well george and paul were resentful and said it wasn't fast enough now if you go into details of what a hit record is and isn't maybe but the beatles could have afforded to put out the slow understandable version of 'revolution' as a single whether it was a gold record or a wooden record but because they were so upset about the yoko period and the fact that i was again becoming as creative and dominating as i had been in the early days after lying fallow for a couple of years it upset the apple cart i was awake again and they couldn't stand it  she inspired all this creation in me it wasn't that she inspired the songs; she inspired me the statement in 'revolution' was mine the lyrics stand today it's still my feeling about politics i want to see the plan that is what i used to say to abbie hoffman and jerry rubin count me out if it is for violence don't expect me to be on the barricades unless it is with flowers  well he got what he wanted which is to be sort of an underground hero for anybody who still worships any manifestation of the underground i don't feel that much about it anymore nixon hoffman it's the same they are all from the same period it was kind of surprising to see abbie on tv but it was also surprising to see nixon on tv maybe people get the feeling when they see me or us i feel what are they doing there is this an old newsreel  it's not a new message 'give peace a chance'-- we're not being unreasonable just saying 'give it a chance' with 'imagine' we're saying 'can you imagine a world without countries or religions' it's the same message over and over and it's positive  it's very sad anyway we're not saying anything new a) we have already said it and b)  other people have said it too  all we are saying is 'this is what is happening to us' we are sending postcards i don't let it become 'i am the awakened; you are sheep that will be shown the way' that is the danger of saying anything you know  listen there's nothing wrong with following examples we can have figure heads and people we admire but we don't need leaders 'don't follow leaders watch the parking meters'  i don't like to comment on it for whatever reason he's doing it it is personal for him and he needs to do it but the whole religion business suffers from the 'onward christian soldiers' bit there's too much talk about soldiers and marching and converting i'm not pushing buddhism because i'm no more a buddhist than i am a christian but there's one thing i admire about the religion there's no proselytizing  no i stopped listening to dylan with both ears after 'highway ' [sic] and 'blonde on blonde' and even then it was because george would sit me down and make me listen  had dear i had a father complex  she fought with janov all the time he couldn't deal with it  and i was the lucky cripple she chose!  alot of us are looking for fathers mine was physically not there most people's are not there mentally and physically like always at the office or busy with other things so all these leaders parking meters are all substitute fathers whether they be religious or political all this bit about electing a president we pick our own daddy out of a dog pound of daddies this is the daddy that looks like the daddy in the commercials he's got the nice gray hair and the right teeth and the parting's on the right side ok this is the daddy we choose the dog pound of daddies which is the political arena gives us a president then we put him on a platform and start punishing him and screaming at him because daddy can't do miracles daddy doesn't heal us  maharishi was a father figure elvis presley might have been a father figure i don't know robert mitchum any male image is a father figure there's nothing wrong with it until you give them the right to give you sort of a recipe for your life what happens is somebody comes along with a good piece of truth instead of the truth's being looked at the person who brought it is looked at the messenger is worshiped instead of the message so there would be christianity mohammedanism buddhism confucianism marxism maoism-- everything-- it is always about a person and never about what he says  well you went to est  we went to janov for the same reason  yeah but i wouldn't go and sit in a room and not pee  oh but i had you with me  but nobody's perfect etc etc whether it's janov or erhardt or maharishi or a beatle that doesn't take away from their message it's like learning how to swim the swimming is fine but forget about the teacher if the beatles had a message it was that with the beatles the records are the point not the beatles as individuals you don't need the package just as you don't need the christian package or the marxist package to get the message people always got the image i was an anti-christ or antireligion i'm not i'm a most religious fellow i was brought up a christian and i only now understand some of the things that christ was saying in those parables because people got hooked on the teacher and missed the message  if the beatles or the sixties had a message it was to learn to swim period and once you learn to swim swim the people who are hung up on the beatles' and the sixties' dream missed the whole point when the beatles' and the sixties' dream became the point carrying the beatles' or the sixties' dream around all your life is like carrying the second world war and glenn miller around that's not to say you can't enjoy glenn miller or the beatles but to live in that dream is the twilight zone it's not living now it's an illusion  well you make your own dream that's the beatles' story isn't it that's yoko's story that's what i'm saying now produce your own dream if you want to save peru go save peru it's quite possible to do anything but not to put it on the leaders and the parking meters don't expect jimmy carter or ronald reagan or john lennon or yoko ono or bob dylan or jesus christ to come and do it for you you have to do it yourself that's what the great masters and mistresses have been saying ever since time began they can point the way leave signposts and little instructions in various books that are now called holy and worshiped for the cover of the book and not for what it says but the instructions are all there for all to see have always been and always will be there's nothing new under the sun all the roads lead to rome and people cannot provide it for you i can't wake you up you can wake you up i can't cure you you can cure you  it's fear of the unknown the unknown is what it is and to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams illusions wars peace love hate all that it's all illusion unknown is what what it is accept that it's unknown and it's plain sailing everything is unknown then you're ahead of the game that's what it is right
